<h2><a name="png.008" id="png.008"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">1</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><b>I</b><br
 />THE CAT-HOOD OF MAURICE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">To</span> have your hair cut is not painful, nor does it
hurt to have your whiskers trimmed. But round
wooden shoes, shaped like bowls, are not comfortable
wear, however much it may amuse the
onlooker to see you try to walk in them. If
you have a nice fur coat like a company promoter&#8217;s,
it is most annoying to be made to swim
in it. And if you had a tail, surely it would be
solely your own affair; that any one should tie
a tin can to it would strike you as an unwarrantable
impertinence&mdash;to say the least.</p>

<p>Yet it is difficult for an outsider to see these
things from the point of view of both the
persons concerned. To Maurice, scissors in
hand, alive and earnest to snip, it seemed the
most natural thing in the world to shorten the
stiff whiskers of Lord Hugh Cecil by a generous
inch. He did not understand how useful those
whiskers were to Lord Hugh, both in sport and
in the more serious business of getting a living.
<a name="png.009" id="png.009"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">2</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>Also it amused Maurice to throw Lord Hugh
into ponds, though Lord Hugh only once permitted
this liberty. To put walnuts on Lord
Hugh&#8217;s feet and then to watch him walk on ice
was, in Maurice&#8217;s opinion, as good as a play.
Lord Hugh was a very favourite cat, but
Maurice was discreet, and Lord Hugh, except
under violent suffering, was at that time anyhow,
dumb.</p>

<p>But the empty sardine-tin attached to Lord
Hugh&#8217;s tail and hind legs&mdash;this had a voice,
and, rattling against stairs, banisters, and the
legs of stricken furniture, it cried aloud for
vengeance. Lord Hugh, suffering violently,
added his voice, and this time the family heard.
There was a chase, a chorus of &lsquo;Poor pussy!&rsquo;
and &lsquo;Pussy, then!&rsquo; and the tail and the tin and
Lord Hugh were caught under Jane&#8217;s bed.
The tail and the tin acquiesced in their rescue.
Lord Hugh did not. He fought, scratched,
and bit. Jane carried the scars of that rescue
for many a long week.</p>

<p>When all was calm Maurice was sought and,
after some little natural delay, found&mdash;in the
boot-cupboard.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Maurice!&rsquo; his mother almost sobbed,
&lsquo;how <em>can</em> you? What will your father say?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maurice thought he knew what his father
would do.</p>

<p><a name="png.010" id="png.010"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">3</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t you know,&rsquo; the mother went on,
&lsquo;how wrong it is to be cruel?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t mean to be cruel,&rsquo; Maurice said.
And, what is more, he spoke the truth. All
the unwelcome attentions he had showered on
Lord Hugh had not been exactly intended to
hurt that stout veteran&mdash;only it was interesting
to see what a cat would do if you threw it in
the water, or cut its whiskers, or tied things to
its tail.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, but you must have meant to be
cruel,&rsquo; said mother, &lsquo;and you will have to be
punished.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish I hadn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Maurice, from the heart.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said his mother, with a sigh;
&lsquo;but it isn&#8217;t the first time; you know you tied
Lord Hugh up in a bag with the hedgehog
only last Tuesday week. You&#8217;d better go to
your room and think it over. I shall have to
tell your father directly he comes home.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maurice went to his room and thought it
over. And the more he thought the more he
hated Lord Hugh. Why couldn&#8217;t the beastly
cat have held his tongue and sat still? That,
at the time would have been a disappointment,
but now Maurice wished it had happened. He
sat on the edge of his bed and savagely kicked
the edge of the green Kidderminster carpet,
and hated the cat.</p>

<p><a name="png.011" id="png.011"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">4</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He hadn&#8217;t meant to be cruel; he was sure
he hadn&#8217;t; he wouldn&#8217;t have pinched the cat&#8217;s
feet or squeezed its tail in the door, or pulled
its whiskers, or poured hot water on it. He
felt himself ill-used, and knew that he would
feel still more so after the inevitable interview
with his father.</p>

<p>But that interview did not take the immediately
painful form expected by Maurice. His
father did <em>not</em> say, &lsquo;Now I will show you what
it feels like to be hurt.&rsquo; Maurice had braced
himself for that, and was looking beyond it to
the calm of forgiveness which should follow the
storm in which he should so unwillingly take
part. No; his father was already calm and
reasonable&mdash;with a dreadful calm, a terrifying
reason.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here, my boy,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;This
cruelty to dumb animals must be checked&mdash;severely
checked.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t mean to be cruel,&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Evil,&rsquo; said Mr. Basingstoke, for such was
Maurice&#8217;s surname, &lsquo;is wrought by want of
thought as well as want of heart. What about
your putting the hen in the oven?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You know,&rsquo; said Maurice, pale but determined,
&lsquo;you <em>know</em> I only wanted to help her to
get her eggs hatched quickly. It says in &ldquo;Fowls
for Food and Fancy&rdquo; that heat hatches eggs.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.012" id="png.012"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">5</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;But she hadn&#8217;t any eggs,&rsquo; said Mr. Basingstoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But she soon would have,&rsquo; urged Maurice.
&lsquo;I thought a stitch in <span class="nw">time&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;That,&rsquo; said his father, &lsquo;is the sort of
thing that you must learn not to think.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll try,&rsquo; said Maurice, miserably hoping
for the best.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I intend that you shall,&rsquo; said Mr. Basingstoke.
&lsquo;This afternoon you go to Dr. Strongitharm&#8217;s
for the remaining week of term. If I
find any more cruelty taking place during the
holidays you will go there permanently. You
can go and get ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, father, <em>please</em> not,&rsquo; was all Maurice
found to say.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sorry, my boy,&rsquo; said his father, much
more kindly; &lsquo;it&#8217;s all for your own good, and
it&#8217;s as painful to me as it is to you&mdash;remember
that. The cab will be here at four. Go and
put your things together, and Jane shall pack
for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the box was packed. Mabel, Maurice&#8217;s
kiddy sister, cried over everything as it was
put in. It was a very wet day.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If it had been any school but old Strong&#8217;s,&rsquo;
she sobbed.</p>

<p>She and her brother knew that school well:
its windows, dulled with wire blinds, its big
<a name="png.013" id="png.013"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">6</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>alarm bell, the high walls of its grounds,
bristling with spikes, the iron gates, always
locked, through which gloomy boys, imprisoned,
scowled on a free world. Dr.
Strongitharm&#8217;s was a school &lsquo;for backward
and difficult boys.&rsquo; Need I say more?</p>

<p>Well, there was no help for it. The box
was packed, the cab was at the door. The
farewells had been said. Maurice determined
that he wouldn&#8217;t cry and he didn&#8217;t, which gave
him the one touch of pride and joy that such a
scene could yield. Then at the last moment,
just as father had one leg in the cab, the Taxes
called. Father went back into the house to
write a cheque. Mother and Mabel had
retired in tears. Maurice used the reprieve to
go back after his postage-stamp album.
Already he was planning how to impress the
other boys at old Strong&#8217;s, and his was really a
very fair collection. He ran up into the schoolroom,
expecting to find it empty. But some
one was there: Lord Hugh, in the very middle
of the ink-stained table-cloth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You brute,&rsquo; said Maurice; &lsquo;you know
jolly well I&#8217;m going away, or you wouldn&#8217;t be
here.&rsquo; And, indeed, the room had never,
somehow, been a favourite of Lord Hugh&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Meaow,&rsquo; said Lord Hugh.</p>

</div>

<p>&lsquo;Mew!&rsquo; said Maurice, with scorn. &lsquo;That&#8217;s
<a name="png.016" id="png.016"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">7</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>what you always say. All that fuss about a
jolly little sardine-tin. Any one would have
thought you&#8217;d be only too glad to have it to
play with. I wonder how you&#8217;d like being a
boy? Lickings, and lessons, and impots, and
sent back from breakfast to wash your ears.
You wash yours anywhere&mdash;I wonder what
they&#8217;d say to me if I washed my ears on the
drawing-room hearthrug?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Meaow,&rsquo; said Lord Hugh, and washed an
ear, as though he were showing off.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mew,&rsquo; said Maurice again; &lsquo;that&#8217;s all
you can say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, no, it isn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Lord Hugh, and
stopped his ear-washing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say!&rsquo; said Maurice in awestruck tones.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you think cats have such a jolly time,&rsquo;
said Lord Hugh, &lsquo;why not <em>be</em> a cat?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would if I could,&rsquo; said Maurice, &lsquo;and
fight <span class="nw">you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Lord Hugh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I can&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, you can,&rsquo; said Lord Hugh.
&lsquo;You&#8217;ve only got to say the word.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What word?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Lord Hugh told him the word; but I will
not tell you, for fear you should say it by
accident and then be sorry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And if I say that, I shall turn into a cat?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.017" id="png.017"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">8</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said the cat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, yes, I see,&rsquo; said Maurice. &lsquo;But I&#8217;m
not taking any, thanks. I don&#8217;t want to be
a cat for always.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You needn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Lord Hugh. &lsquo;You&#8217;ve
only got to get some one to say to you, &ldquo;Please <!-- original lacks opening double quote -->
leave off being a cat and be Maurice again,&rdquo;
and there you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maurice thought of Dr. Strongitharm&#8217;s. He
also thought of the horror of his father when
he should find Maurice gone, vanished, not to
be traced. &lsquo;He&#8217;ll be sorry, then,&rsquo; Maurice told
himself, and to the cat he said, suddenly:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Right&mdash;I&#8217;ll do it. What&#8217;s the word,
again?&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="nw">&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo;</span> said the cat.</p>

<p><span class="nw">&lsquo;&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo;</span> said Maurice; and suddenly the
table shot up to the height of a house, the
walls to the height of tenement buildings, the
pattern on the carpet became enormous, and
Maurice found himself on all fours. He tried
to stand up on his feet, but his shoulders were
oddly heavy. He could only rear himself
upright for a moment, and then fell heavily
on his hands. He looked down at them; they
seemed to have grown shorter and fatter, and
were encased in black fur gloves. He felt a
desire to walk on all fours&mdash;tried it&mdash;did it.
It was very odd&mdash;the movement of the arms
<a name="png.018" id="png.018"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">9</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>straight from the shoulder, more like the
movement of the piston of an engine than anything
Maurice could think of at that moment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am asleep,&rsquo; said Maurice&mdash;&lsquo;I am dreaming
this. I am dreaming I am a cat. I hope I
dreamed that about the sardine-tin and Lord
Hugh&#8217;s tail, and Dr. Strong&#8217;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You didn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said a voice he knew and yet
didn&#8217;t know, &lsquo;and you aren&#8217;t dreaming this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; said Maurice; &lsquo;and now I&#8217;m
going to dream that I fight that beastly black
cat, and give him the best licking he ever had
in his life. Come on, Lord Hugh.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A loud laugh answered him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Excuse my smiling,&rsquo; said the voice he
knew and didn&#8217;t know, &lsquo;but don&#8217;t you see&mdash;you
<em>are</em> Lord Hugh!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A great hand picked Maurice up from the
floor and held him in the air. He felt the
position to be not only undignified but unsafe,
and gave himself a shake of mingled relief and
resentment when the hand set him down on
the inky table-cloth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are Lord Hugh now, my dear Maurice,&rsquo;
said the voice, and a huge face came quite
close to his. It was his own face, as it would
have seemed through a magnifying glass. And
the voice&mdash;oh, horror!&mdash;the voice was his own
voice&mdash;Maurice Basingstoke&#8217;s voice. Maurice
<a name="png.019" id="png.019"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">10</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>shrank from the voice, and he would have
liked to claw the face, but he had had no
practice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are Lord Hugh,&rsquo; the voice repeated,
&lsquo;and I am Maurice. I like being Maurice.
I am so large and strong. I could drown you
in the water-butt, my poor cat&mdash;oh, so easily.
No, don&#8217;t spit and swear. It&#8217;s bad manners&mdash;even
in a cat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Maurice!&rsquo; shouted Mr. Basingstoke from
between the door and the cab.</p>

<p>Maurice, from habit, leaped towards the
door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s no use <em>your</em> going,&rsquo; said the thing
that looked like a giant reflection of Maurice;
&lsquo;it&#8217;s <em>me</em> he wants.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I didn&#8217;t agree to your being me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s poetry, even if it isn&#8217;t grammar,&rsquo;
said the thing that looked like Maurice. &lsquo;Why,
my good cat, don&#8217;t you see that if you are I,
I must be you? Otherwise we should interfere
with time and space, upset the balance of power,
and as likely as not destroy the solar system.
Oh, yes&mdash;I&#8217;m you, right enough, and shall be,
till some one tells you to change from Lord
Hugh into Maurice. And now you&#8217;ve got to
find some one to do it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(&lsquo;Maurice!&rsquo; thundered the voice of Mr.
Basingstoke.)</p>

<p><a name="png.020" id="png.020"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">11</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;That&#8217;ll be easy enough,&rsquo; said Maurice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think so?&rsquo; said the other.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t try yet. I want to have
some fun first. I shall catch heaps of mice!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think so? You forget that your whiskers
are cut off&mdash;Maurice cut them. Without
whiskers, how can you judge of the width of
the places you go through? Take care you
don&#8217;t get stuck in a hole that you can&#8217;t get out
of or go in through, my good cat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t call me a cat,&rsquo; said Maurice, and
felt that his tail was growing thick and angry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You <em>are</em> a cat, you know&mdash;and that little
bit of temper that I see in your tail reminds
<span class="nw">me&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>Maurice felt himself gripped round the
middle, abruptly lifted, and carried swiftly
through the air. The quickness of the movement
made him giddy. The light went so
quickly past him that it might as well have
been darkness. He saw nothing, felt nothing,
except a sort of long sea-sickness, and then
suddenly he was not being moved. He could
see now. He could feel. He was being held
tight in a sort of vice&mdash;a vice covered with
chequered cloth. It looked like the pattern,
very much exaggerated, of his school knickerbockers.
It <em>was</em>. He was being held between
the hard, relentless knees of that creature that
<a name="png.021" id="png.021"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">12</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>had once been Lord Hugh, and to whose tail
he had tied a sardine-tin. Now <em>he</em> was Lord
Hugh, and something was being tied to <em>his</em>
tail. Something mysterious, terrible. Very
well, he would show that he was not afraid of
anything that could be attached to tails. The
string rubbed his fur the wrong way&mdash;it was
that that annoyed him, not the string itself;
and as for what was at the end of the string,
what <em>could</em> that matter to any sensible cat?
Maurice was quite decided that he was&mdash;and
would keep on being&mdash;a sensible cat.</p>

<p>The string, however, and the uncomfortable,
tight position between those chequered
knees&mdash;something or other was getting on his
nerves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Maurice!&rsquo; shouted his father below, and
the be-catted Maurice bounded between the
knees of the creature <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'than'">that</ins> wore his clothes and
his looks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Coming, father,&rsquo; this thing called, and
sped away, leaving Maurice on the servant&#8217;s
bed&mdash;under which Lord Hugh had taken
refuge, with his tin-can, so short and yet so
long a time ago. The stairs re-echoed to the
loud boots which Maurice had never before
thought loud; he had often, indeed, wondered
that any one could object to them. He wondered
now no longer.</p>

<p><a name="png.022" id="png.022"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">13</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He heard the front door slam. That thing
had gone to Dr. Strongitharm&#8217;s. That was
one comfort. Lord Hugh was a boy now; he
would know what it was to be a boy. He,
Maurice, was a cat, and he meant to taste
fully all catty pleasures, from milk to mice.
Meanwhile he was without mice or milk, and,
unaccustomed as he was to a tail, he could
not but feel that all was not right with his
own. There was a feeling of weight, a feeling
of discomfort, of positive terror. If he should
move, what would that thing that was tied to
his tail do? Rattle, of course. Oh, but he
could not bear it if that thing rattled. Nonsense;
it was only a sardine-tin. Yes, Maurice knew
that. But all the same&mdash;if it did rattle! He
moved his tail the least little soft inch. No
sound. Perhaps really there wasn&#8217;t anything
tied to his tail. But he couldn&#8217;t be sure unless
he moved. But if he moved the thing would
rattle, and if it rattled Maurice felt sure that
he would expire or go mad. A mad cat.
What a dreadful thing to be! Yet he couldn&#8217;t
sit on that bed for ever, waiting, waiting, waiting
for the dreadful thing to happen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, dear,&rsquo; sighed Maurice the cat. &lsquo;I
never knew what people meant by &ldquo;afraid&rdquo;
before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>His cat-heart was beating heavily against
<a name="png.023" id="png.023"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">14</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>his furry side. His limbs were getting cramped&mdash;he
must move. He did. And instantly
the awful thing happened. The sardine-tin
touched the iron of the bed-foot. It rattled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I can&#8217;t bear it, I can&#8217;t,&rsquo; cried poor
Maurice, in a heartrending meaow that echoed
through the house. He leaped from the bed
and tore through the door and down the stairs,
and behind him came the most terrible thing
in the world. People might call it a sardine-tin,
but he knew better. It was the soul of
all the fear that ever had been or ever could
be. <em>It rattled.</em></p>

<p>Maurice who was a cat flew down the stairs;
down, down&mdash;the rattling horror followed. Oh,
horrible! Down, down! At the foot of the
stairs the horror, caught by something&mdash;a
banister&mdash;a stair-rod&mdash;stopped. The string
on Maurice&#8217;s tail tightened, his tail was jerked,
he was stopped. But the noise had stopped
too. Maurice lay only just alive at the foot of
the stairs.</p>

<p>It was Mabel who untied the string and
soothed his terrors with strokings and tender
love-words. Maurice was surprised to find
what a nice little girl his sister really was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll never tease you again,&rsquo; he tried to say,
softly&mdash;but that was not what he said. What
he said was &lsquo;Purrrr.&rsquo;</p>

 class="pgmark">15</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Dear pussy, nice poor pussy, then,&rsquo; said
Mabel, and she hid away the sardine-tin and
did not tell any one. This seemed unjust to
Maurice until he remembered that, of course,
Mabel thought that he was really Lord Hugh,
and that the person who had tied the tin to his
tail was her brother Maurice. Then he was
half grateful. She carried him down, in soft,
safe arms, to the kitchen, and asked cook to
give him some milk.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me to change back into Maurice,&rsquo; said
Maurice who was quite worn out by his cattish
experiences. But no one heard him. What
they heard was, &lsquo;Meaow&mdash;Meaow&mdash;Meeeaow!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Maurice saw how he had been tricked.
He could be changed back into a boy as soon
as any one said to him, &lsquo;Leave off being a cat
and be Maurice again,&rsquo; but his tongue had no
longer the power to ask any one to say it.</p>

<p>He did not sleep well that night. For one
thing he was not accustomed to sleeping on the
kitchen hearthrug, and the blackbeetles were
too many and too cordial. He was glad when
cook came down and turned him out into
the garden, where the October frost still lay
white on the yellowed stalks of sunflowers and
nasturtiums. He took a walk, climbed a tree,
failed to catch a bird, and felt better. He
began also to feel hungry. A delicious scent
<a name="png.027" id="png.027"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">16</span><span class="ns">
 </span>came stealing out of the back kitchen door.
Oh, joy, there were to be herrings for breakfast!
Maurice hastened in and took his place
on his usual chair.</p>

<p>His mother said, &lsquo;Down, puss,&rsquo; and gently
tilted the chair so that Maurice fell off it. Then
the family had herrings. Maurice said, &lsquo;You
might give me some,&rsquo; and he said it so often
that his father, who, of course, heard only
mewings, said:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For goodness&#8217; sake put that cat out of the
room.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maurice breakfasted later, in the dust-bin,
on herring heads.</p>

<p>But he kept himself up with a new and
splendid idea. They would give him milk
presently, and then they should see.</p>

<p>He spent the afternoon sitting on the sofa
in the dining-room, listening to the conversation
of his father and mother. It is said that
listeners never hear any good of themselves.
Maurice heard so much that he was surprised
and humbled. He heard his father say that
he was a fine, plucky little chap, but he needed
a severe lesson, and Dr. Strongitharm was the
man to give it to him. He heard his mother
say things that made his heart throb in his
throat and the tears prick behind those green
cat-eyes of his. He had always thought his
<a name="png.030" id="png.030"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">17</span><span class="ns">]
 </span>parents a little bit unjust. Now they did him
so much more than justice that he felt quite
small and mean inside his cat-skin.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.029" id="png.029"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-029.png"
 width="516" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />He landed there on his four padded feet light as a feather.</p>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s a dear, good, affectionate boy,&rsquo; said
mother. &lsquo;It&#8217;s only his high spirits. Don&#8217;t
you think, darling, perhaps you were a little
hard on him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was for his own good,&rsquo; said father.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said mother; &lsquo;but I can&#8217;t
bear to think of him at that dreadful school.&rsquo;</p>

<p><span class="nw">&lsquo;Well&mdash;&mdash;,&rsquo;</span> father was beginning, when
Jane came in with the tea-things on a clattering
tray, whose sound made Maurice tremble in
every leg. Father and mother began to talk
about the weather.</p>

<p>Maurice felt very affectionately to both his
parents. The natural way of showing this was
to jump on to the sideboard and thence on to
his father&#8217;s shoulders. He landed there on his
four padded feet, light as a feather, but father
was not pleased.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bother the cat!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Jane, put it
out of the room.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maurice was put out. His great idea, which
was to be carried out with milk, would certainly
not be carried out in the dining-room. He
sought the kitchen, and, seeing a milk-can on
the window-ledge, jumped up beside the can
and patted it as he had seen Lord Hugh do.</p>

<p><a name="png.031" id="png.031"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">18</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;My!&rsquo; said a friend of Jane&#8217;s who happened
to be there, &lsquo;ain&#8217;t that cat clever&mdash;a perfect
moral, I call her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s nothing to boast of this time,&rsquo; said
cook. &lsquo;I will say for Lord Hugh he&#8217;s not
often taken in with a empty can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was naturally mortifying for Maurice, but
he pretended not to hear, and jumped from the
window to the tea-table and patted the milk-jug.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the cook, &lsquo;that&#8217;s more like it,&rsquo;
and she poured him out a full saucer and set it
on the floor.</p>

<p>Now was the chance Maurice had longed
for. Now he could carry out that idea of his.
He was very thirsty, for he had had nothing
since that delicious breakfast in the dust-bin.
But not for worlds would he have drunk the
milk. No. He carefully dipped his right paw
in it, for his idea was to make letters with it <!-- original has extraneous period -->
on the kitchen oil-cloth. He meant to write:
&lsquo;Please tell me to leave off being a cat and be
Maurice again,&rsquo; but he found his paw a very
clumsy pen, and he had to rub out the first
&lsquo;P&rsquo; because it only looked like an accident.
Then he tried again and actually did make a
&lsquo;P&rsquo; that any fair-minded person could have
read quite easily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish they&#8217;d notice,&rsquo; he said, and before
he got the &lsquo;l&rsquo; written they did notice.</p>

<p><a name="png.032" id="png.032"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">19</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Drat the cat,&rsquo; said cook; &lsquo;look how he&#8217;s
messing the floor up.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And she took away the milk.</p>

<p>Maurice put pride aside and mewed to have
the milk put down again. But he did not
get it.</p>

<p>Very weary, very thirsty, and very tired of
being Lord Hugh, he presently found his way
to the schoolroom, where Mabel with patient
toil was doing her home-lessons. She took
him on her lap and stroked him while she
learned her French verb. He felt that he was
growing very fond of her. People were quite
right to be kind to dumb animals. Presently
she had to stop stroking him and do a map.
And after that she kissed him and put him
down and went away. All the time she had
been doing the map, Maurice had had but one
thought: <em>Ink!</em></p>

<p>The moment the door had closed behind
her&mdash;how sensible people were who closed doors
gently&mdash;he stood up in her chair with one paw
on the map and the other on the ink. Unfortunately,
the inkstand top was made to
dip pens in, and not to dip paws. But Maurice
was desperate. He deliberately upset the ink&mdash;most
of it rolled over the table-cloth and fell
pattering on the carpet, but with what was left
he wrote quite plainly, across the map:&mdash;</p>

<div class="semi"><!-- weird linebreaks as per original -->
<a name="png.033" id="png.033"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span

 /></span>&lsquo;Please tell Lord Hugh<br
 />to stop being<br
 />a cat and be Mau<br

</div>

<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;they can&#8217;t make any
mistake about that.&rsquo; They didn&#8217;t. But they
made a mistake about who had done it, and
Mabel was deprived of jam with her supper
bread.</p>

<p>Her assurance that some naughty boy must
have come through the window and done it
while she was not there convinced nobody,
and, indeed, the window was shut and bolted.</p>

<p>Maurice, wild with indignation, did not
mend matters by seizing the opportunity of a
few minutes&#8217; solitude to write:&mdash;</p>

<div class="semi"><!-- weird linebreaks as per original -->
&lsquo;It was not Mabel<br

</div>

<p class="cont">because when that was seen Mabel was instantly
sent to bed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s not fair!&rsquo; cried Maurice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Maurice&#8217;s father, &lsquo;if that
cat goes on mewing to this extent you&#8217;ll have
to get rid of it.&rsquo;</p>

</div>

<p>Maurice said not another word. It was
bad enough to be a cat, but to be a cat that
was &lsquo;got rid <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'off'">of</ins>&rsquo;! He knew how people got
rid of cats. In a stricken silence he left the
<a name="png.036" id="png.036"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">21</span><span class="ns">
 </span>room and slunk up the stairs&mdash;he dared not
mew again, even at the door of Mabel&#8217;s room.
But when Jane went in to put Mabel&#8217;s light
out Maurice crept in too, and in the dark tried
with stifled mews and purrs to explain to Mabel
how sorry he was. Mabel stroked him and he
went to sleep, his last waking thought amazement
at the blindness that had once made him
call her a silly little kid.</p>

<p>If you have ever been a cat you will understand
something of what Maurice endured
during the dreadful days that followed. If you
have not, I can never make you understand
fully. There was the affair of the fishmonger&#8217;s
tray balanced on the wall by the back door&mdash;the
delicious curled-up whiting; Maurice knew
as well as you do that one mustn&#8217;t steal fish
out of other people&#8217;s trays, but the cat that he
was didn&#8217;t know. There was an inward
struggle&mdash;and Maurice was beaten by the cat-nature.
Later he was beaten by the cook.</p>

<p>Then there was that very painful incident
with the butcher&#8217;s dog, the flight across gardens,
the safety of the plum tree gained only just in
time.</p>

<p>And, worst of all, despair took hold of him,
for he saw that nothing he could do would
make any one say those simple words that
would release him. He had hoped that Mabel
<a name="png.037" id="png.037"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">22</span><span class="ns">
 </span>might at last be made to understand, but the
ink had failed him; she did not understand his
subdued mewings, and when he got the cardboard
letters and made the same sentence with
them Mabel only thought it was that naughty
boy who came through locked windows.
Somehow he could not spell before any one&mdash;his
nerves were not what they had been. His
brain now gave him no new ideas. He felt
that he was really growing like a cat in his
mind. His interest in his meals grew beyond
even what it had been when they were a schoolboy&#8217;s
meals. He hunted mice with growing
enthusiasm, though the loss of his whiskers to
measure narrow places with made hunting
difficult.</p>

<p>He grew expert in bird-stalking, and often
got quite near to a bird before it flew away,
laughing at him. But all the time, in his heart,
he was very, very miserable. And so the
week went by.</p>

<p>Maurice in his cat shape dreaded more and
more the time when Lord Hugh in the boy
shape should come back from Dr. Strongitharm&#8217;s.
He knew&mdash;who better?&mdash;exactly the kind of
things boys do to cats, and he trembled to the
end of his handsome half-Persian tail.</p>

<p>And then the boy came home from Dr.
Strongitharm&#8217;s, and at the first sound of his
<a name="png.038" id="png.038"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">23</span><span class="ns">
 </span>boots in the hall Maurice in the cat&#8217;s body
fled with silent haste to hide in the boot-cupboard.</p>

<p>Here, ten minutes later, the boy that had
come back from Dr. Strongitharm&#8217;s found
him.</p>

<p>Maurice fluffed up his tail and unsheathed
his claws. Whatever this boy was going to do
to him Maurice meant to resist, and his resistance
should hurt the boy as much as possible.
I am sorry to say Maurice swore softly among
the boots, but cat-swearing is not really wrong.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come out, you old duffer,&rsquo; said Lord
Hugh in the boy shape of Maurice. &lsquo;I&#8217;m not
going to hurt you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll see to that,&rsquo; said Maurice, backing into
the corner, all teeth and claws.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve had such a time!&rsquo; said Lord
Hugh. &lsquo;It&#8217;s no use, you know, old chap; I
can see where you are by your green eyes.
My word, they do shine. I&#8217;ve been caned and
shut up in a dark room and given thousands of
lines to write out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ve been beaten, too, if you come to
that,&rsquo; mewed Maurice. &lsquo;Besides the butcher&#8217;s
dog.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was an intense relief to speak to some one
who could understand his mews.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I suppose it&#8217;s Pax for the future,&rsquo;
<a name="png.039" id="png.039"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">24</span><span class="ns">
 </span>said Lord Hugh; &lsquo;if you won&#8217;t come out, you
won&#8217;t. Please leave off being a cat and be
Maurice again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And instantly Maurice, amid a heap of
goloshes and old tennis bats, felt with a swelling
heart that he was no longer a cat. No more
of those undignified four legs, those tiresome
pointed ears, so difficult to wash, that furry
coat, that contemptible tail, and that terrible
inability to express all one&#8217;s feelings in two
words&mdash;&lsquo;mew&rsquo; and &lsquo;purr.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He scrambled out of the cupboard, and the
boots and goloshes fell off him like spray off a
bather.</p>

<p>He stood upright in those very chequered
knickerbockers that were so terrible when their
knees held one vice-like, while things were
tied to one&#8217;s tail. He was face to face with
another boy, exactly like himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>You</em> haven&#8217;t changed, then&mdash;but there can&#8217;t
be two Maurices.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be; not if I know it,&rsquo; said
the other boy; &lsquo;a boy&#8217;s <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'life'">life&#8217;s</ins> a dog&#8217;s life.
Quick, before any one comes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quick what?&rsquo; asked Maurice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why tell me to leave off being a boy, and
to be Lord Hugh Cecil again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Maurice told him at once. And at once the
boy was gone, and there was Lord Hugh in
<a name="png.040" id="png.040"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">25</span><span class="ns">
 </span>his own shape, purring politely, yet with a
watchful eye on Maurice&#8217;s movements.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you needn&#8217;t be afraid, old chap. It&#8217;s
Pax right enough,&rsquo; Maurice murmured in the
ear of Lord Hugh. And Lord Hugh, arching
his back under Maurice&#8217;s stroking hand, replied
with a purrrr-meaow that spoke volumes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Maurice, here you are. It <em>is</em> nice of
you to be nice to Lord Hugh, when it was
because of him <span class="nw">you&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s a good old chap,&rsquo; said Maurice, carelessly.
&lsquo;And <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'your'">you&#8217;re</ins> not half a bad old girl. See?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Mabel almost wept for joy at this magnificent
compliment, and Lord Hugh himself took on a
more happy and confident air.</p>

<p>Please dismiss any fears which you may
entertain that after this Maurice became a model
boy. He didn&#8217;t. But he was much nicer than
before. The conversation which he overheard
when he was a cat makes him more patient
with his father and mother. And he is almost
always nice to Mabel, for he cannot forget all
that she was to him when he wore the shape of
Lord Hugh. His father attributes all the
improvement in his son&#8217;s character to that week
at Dr. Strongitharm&#8217;s&mdash;which, as you know,
Maurice never had. Lord Hugh&#8217;s character
is unchanged. Cats learn slowly and with
difficulty.</p>

 class="pgmark">26</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Only Maurice and Lord Hugh know the truth&mdash;Maurice
has never told it to any one except
me, and Lord Hugh is a very reserved cat.
He never at any time had that free flow of mew
which distinguished and endangered the cat-hood
of Maurice.</p>

 />THE MIXED MINE</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> ship was first sighted off Dungeness. She
was labouring heavily. Her paint was peculiar
and her rig outlandish. She looked like a
golden ship out of a painted picture.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Blessed if I ever see such a rig&mdash;nor such
lines neither,&rsquo; old Hawkhurst said.</p>

<p>It was a late afternoon, wild and grey.
Slate-coloured clouds drove across the sky like
flocks of hurried camels. The waves were
purple and blue, and in the west a streak of
unnatural-looking green light was all that stood
for the splendours of sunset.</p>

<p>&lsquo;She do be a rum &#8217;un,&rsquo; said young Benenden,
who had strolled along the beach with the
glasses the gentleman gave him for saving the
little boy from drowning. &lsquo;Don&#8217;t know as I
ever see another just like her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;d give half a dollar to any chap as can
tell me where she hails from&mdash;and what port
<a name="png.043" id="png.043"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">28</span><span class="ns">
 </span>it is where they has ships o&#8217; that cut,&rsquo; said
middle-aged Haversham to the group that had
now gathered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;George!&rsquo; exclaimed young Benenden from
under his field-glasses, &lsquo;she&#8217;s going.&rsquo; And
she went. Her bow went down suddenly and
she stood stern up in the water&mdash;like a duck
after rain. Then quite slowly, with no unseemly
hurry, but with no moment&#8217;s change of
what seemed to be her fixed purpose, the ship
sank and the grey rolling waves wiped out the
place where she had been.</p>

<p>Now I hope you will not expect me to tell
you anything more about this ship&mdash;because
there is nothing more to tell. What country
she came from, what port she was bound for,
what cargo she carried, and what kind of
tongue her crew spoke&mdash;all these things are
dead secrets. And a dead secret is a secret
that nobody knows. No other secrets are
dead secrets. Even I do not know this one,
or I would tell you at once. For I, at least,
have no secrets from you.</p>

 width="536" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />Her bow went down suddenly.</p>
</div>

<p>When ships go down off Dungeness, things
from them have a way of being washed up on
the sands of that bay which curves from Dungeness
to Folkestone, where the sea has bitten a
piece out of the land&mdash;just such a half-moon-shaped
piece as you bite out of a slice of
<a name="png.046" id="png.046"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">29</span><span class="ns">
 </span>bread-and-butter. Bits of wood tangled with ropes&mdash;broken
furniture&mdash;ships&#8217; biscuits in barrels and
kegs that have held brandy&mdash;seamen&#8217;s chests&mdash;and
sometimes sadder things that we will not
talk about just now.</p>

<p>Now, if you live by the sea and are grown-up
you know that if you find anything on the
seashore (I don&#8217;t mean starfish or razor-shells
or jellyfish and sea-mice, but anything out of a
ship that you would really like to keep) your
duty is to take it up to the coast-guard and say,
&lsquo;Please, I&#8217;ve found this.&rsquo; Then the coast-guard
will send it to the proper authority, and
one of these days you&#8217;ll get a reward of one-third
of the value of whatever it was that you
picked up. But two-thirds of the value of anything,
or even three-thirds of its value, is not
at all the same thing as the thing itself&mdash;if it
happened to be the kind of thing you want.
But if you are not grown-up and do not live by
the sea, but in a nice little villa in a nice little
suburb, where all the furniture is new and the
servants wear white aprons and white caps with
long strings in the afternoon, then you won&#8217;t
know anything about your duty, and if you find
anything by the sea you&#8217;ll think that findings
are keepings.</p>

<p>Edward was not grown-up&mdash;and he kept
everything he found, including sea-mice, till the
<a name="png.047" id="png.047"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">30</span><span class="ns">
 </span>landlady of the lodgings where his aunt was
threw his collection into the pig-pail.</p>

<p>Being a quiet and persevering little boy he
did not cry or complain, but having meekly
followed his treasures to their long home&mdash;the
pig was six feet from nose to tail, and ate the
dead sea-mouse as easily and happily as your
father eats an oyster&mdash;he started out to make a
new collection.</p>

<p>And the first thing he found was an oyster-shell
that was pink and green and blue inside,
and the second was an old boot&mdash;very old
indeed&mdash;and the third was <em>it</em>.</p>

<p>It was a square case of old leather embossed
with odd little figures of men and animals and
words that Edward could not read. It was
oblong and had no key, but a sort of leather
hasp, and was curiously knotted with string&mdash;rather
like a boot-lace. And Edward opened
it. There were several things inside: queer-looking
instruments, some rather like those in
the little box of mathematical instruments that
he had had as a prize at school, and some like
nothing he had ever seen before. And in a
deep groove of the russet soaked velvet lining
lay a neat little brass telescope.</p>

<p>T-squares and set-squares and so forth are
of little use on a sandy shore. But you can
always look through a telescope.</p>

<p><a name="png.048" id="png.048"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">31</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Edward picked it out and put it to his eye,
and tried to see through it a little tug that was
sturdily puffing up Channel. He failed to find
the tug, and found himself gazing at a little
cloud on the horizon. As he looked it grew
larger and darker, and presently a spot of rain
fell on his nose. He rubbed it off&mdash;on his
jersey sleeve, I am sorry to say, and not on his
handkerchief. Then he looked through the
glass again; but he found he needed both
hands to keep it steady, so he set down the
box with the other instruments on the sand
at his feet and put the glass to his eye
again.</p>

<p>He never saw the box again. For in his
unpractised efforts to cover the tug with his
glass he found himself looking at the shore
instead of at the sea, and the shore looked so
odd that he could not make up his mind to stop
looking at it.</p>

<p>He had thought it was a sandy shore, but
almost at once he saw that it was not sand but
fine shingle, and the discovery of this mistake
surprised him so much that he kept on looking
at the shingle through the little telescope, which
showed it quite plainly. And as he looked the
shingle grew coarser; it was stones now&mdash;quite
decent-sized stones, large stones, enormous
stones.</p>

<p><a name="png.049" id="png.049"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">32</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Something hard pressed against his foot,
and he lowered the glass.</p>

<p>He was surrounded by big stones, and they
all seemed to be moving; some were tumbling
off others that lay in heaps below them, and
others were rolling away from the beach in
every direction. And the place where he had
put down the box was covered with great stones
which he could not move.</p>

<p>Edward was very much upset. He had
never been accustomed to great stones that
moved about when no one was touching them,
and he looked round for some one to ask how it
had happened.</p>

<p>The only person in sight was another boy
in a blue jersey with red letters on its chest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hi!&rsquo; said Edward, and the boy also said
&lsquo;Hi!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come along here,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;and I&#8217;ll
show you something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Right-o!&rsquo; the boy remarked, and came.</p>

<p>The boy was staying at the camp where the
white tents were below the Grand Redoubt.
His home was quite unlike Edward&#8217;s, though
he also lived with his aunt. The boy&#8217;s home
was very dirty and very small, and nothing in
it was ever in its right place. There was no
furniture to speak of. The servants did not
wear white caps with long streamers, because
<a name="png.050" id="png.050"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">33</span><span class="ns">
 </span>there were no servants. His uncle was a dock-labourer
and his aunt went out washing. But
he had felt just the same pleasure in being
shown things that Edward or you or I might
have felt, and he went climbing over the big
stones to where Edward stood waiting for him
in a sort of pit among the stones with the little
telescope in his hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;did you see any one
move these stones?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I ain&#8217;t only just come up on to the sea-wall,&rsquo;
said the boy, who was called Gustus.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They all came round me,&rsquo; said Edward,
rather pale. &lsquo;I didn&#8217;t see any one shoving
them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who&#8217;re you a-kiddin&#8217; of?&rsquo; the boy inquired.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I <em>did</em>,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;honour bright I
did. I was just taking a squint through this
little telescope I&#8217;ve found&mdash;and they came
rolling up to me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let&#8217;s see what you found,&rsquo; said Gustus,
and Edward gave him the glass. He directed
it with inexpert fingers to the sea-wall, so little
trodden that on it the grass grows, and the
sea-pinks, and even convolvulus and mock-strawberry.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, look!&rsquo; cried Edward, very loud.
&lsquo;Look at the grass!&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.051" id="png.051"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">34</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Gustus let the glass fall to long arm&#8217;s length
and said &lsquo;Krikey!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The grass and flowers on the sea-wall had
grown a foot and a half&mdash;quite tropical they
looked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&#8217;s the matter wiv everyfink?&rsquo; said
Gustus. &lsquo;We must both be a bit balmy,
seems ter me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&#8217;s balmy?&rsquo; asked Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Off your chump&mdash;looney&mdash;like what you
and me is,&rsquo; said Gustus. &lsquo;First I sees things,
then I sees you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was only fancy, I expect,&rsquo; said Edward.
&lsquo;I expect the grass on the sea-wall was always
like that, really.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let&#8217;s have a look through your spy-glass at
that little barge,&rsquo; said Gustus, still holding the
glass. &lsquo;Come on outer these &#8217;ere paving-stones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There was a box,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;a box I
found with lots of jolly things in it. I laid it
down somewhere&mdash;<span class="nw">and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Ain&#8217;t that it over there?&rsquo; Gustus asked,
and levelled the glass at a dark object a
hundred yards away. &lsquo;No; it&#8217;s only an old
boot. I say, this is a fine spy-glass. It does
make things come big.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s not it. I&#8217;m certain I put it down
somewhere just here. Oh, <em>don&#8217;t</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illus">

<p><a name="png.054" id="png.054"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">35</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He snatched the glass from Gustus.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;look!&rsquo; and pointed.</p>

<p>A hundred yards away stood a boot about
as big as the bath you see Marat in at
Madame Tussaud&#8217;s.</p>

<p>&lsquo;S&#8217;welp me,&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;we&#8217;re asleep,
both of us, and a-dreaming as things grow
while we look at them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But we&#8217;re not dreaming,&rsquo; Edward objected.
&lsquo;You let me pinch you and you&#8217;ll see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No fun in that,&rsquo; said Gustus. &lsquo;Tell you
what&mdash;it&#8217;s the spy-glass&mdash;that&#8217;s what it is.
Ever see any conjuring? I see a chap at the
Mile End Empire what made things turn into
things like winking. It&#8217;s the spy-glass, that&#8217;s
what it is.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It can&#8217;t be,&rsquo; said the little boy who lived
in a villa.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it <em>is</em>,&rsquo; said the little boy who lived in
a slum. &lsquo;Teacher says there ain&#8217;t no bounds
to the wonders of science. Blest if this ain&#8217;t
one of &#8217;em.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me look,&rsquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right; only you mark me. Whatever
you sets eyes on&#8217;ll grow and grow&mdash;like the
flower-tree the conjurer had under the wipe.
Don&#8217;t you look at <em>me</em>, that&#8217;s all. Hold on; I&#8217;ll
put something up for you to look at&mdash;a mark
like&mdash;something as doesn&#8217;t matter.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.055" id="png.055"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">36</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He fumbled in his pocket and brought out a
boot-lace.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hold this up,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and you look.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next moment he had dropped the boot-lace,
which, swollen as it was with the magic of the
glass, lay like a snake on the stone at his feet.</p>

<p>So the glass <em>was</em> a magic glass, as, of course,
you know already.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My!&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;wouldn&#8217;t I like to
look at my victuals through that there!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="tb"><br class="ns"/>Thus we find Edward, of the villa&mdash;and
through him Gustus, of the slum&mdash;in possession
of a unique instrument of magic. What could
they do with it?</p>

<p>This was the question which they talked
over every time they met, and they met continually.
Edward&#8217;s aunt, who at home watched
him as cats watch mice, rashly believed that at
the seaside there was no mischief for a boy to
get into. And the gentleman who commanded
the tented camp believed in the ennobling effects
of liberty.</p>

<p>After the boot, neither had dared to look at
anything through the telescope&mdash;and so they
looked <em>at</em> it, and polished it on their sleeves till
it shone again.</p>

<p>Both were agreed that it would be a fine
thing to get some money and look at it, so that
<a name="png.056" id="png.056"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">37</span><span class="ns">
 </span>it would grow big. But Gustus never had any
pocket-money, and Edward had had his confiscated
to pay for a window he had not intended
to break.</p>

<p>Gustus felt certain that some one would find
out about the spy-glass and take it away from
them. His experience was that anything you
happened to like was always taken away.
Edward knew that his aunt would want to take
the telescope away to &lsquo;take care of&rsquo; for him.
This had already happened with the carved
chessmen that his father had sent him from
India.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I been thinking,&rsquo; said Gustus, on the third
day. &lsquo;When I&#8217;m a man I&#8217;m a-going to be a
burglar. You has to use your headpiece in
that trade, I tell you. So I don&#8217;t think thinking&#8217;s
swipes, like some blokes do. And I think
p&#8217;r&#8217;aps it don&#8217;t turn everything big. An&rsquo; if we
could find out what it don&#8217;t turn big we could
see what we wanted to turn big or what it
didn&#8217;t turn big, and then it wouldn&#8217;t turn anything
big except what we wanted it to. See?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edward did not see; and I don&#8217;t suppose
you do, either.</p>

<p>So Gustus went on to explain that teacher
had told him there were some substances
impervious to light, and some to cold, and
so on and so forth, and that what they wanted
<a name="png.057" id="png.057"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">38</span><span class="ns">
 </span>was a substance that should be impervious
to the magic effects of the spy-glass.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So if we get a tanner and set it on a
plate and squint at it it&#8217;ll get bigger&mdash;but
so&#8217;ll the plate. And we don&#8217;t want to litter
the place up with plates the bigness of cartwheels.
But if the plate didn&#8217;t get big we
could look at the tanner till it covered the
plate, and then go on looking and looking
and looking and see nothing but the tanner
till it was as big as a circus. See?&rsquo;</p>

<p>This time Edward did see. But they got
no further, because it was time to go to the
circus. There was a circus at Dymchurch
just then, and that was what made Gustus
think of the sixpence growing to that size.</p>

<p>It was a very nice circus, and all the boys
from the camp went to it&mdash;also Edward, who
managed to scramble over and wriggle under

 />Far above him and every one else towered the elephant.</p>
</div>

<p>It was the size of the elephant that did it.
Edward had not seen an elephant before,
and when he saw it, instead of saying, &lsquo;What
a size he is!&rsquo; as everybody else did, he said
to himself, &lsquo;What a size I could make him!&rsquo;
and pulled out the spy-glass, and by a miracle
of good luck or bad got it levelled at the
elephant as it went by. He turned the glass
slowly&mdash;as it went out&mdash;and the elephant
<a name="png.060" id="png.060"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">39</span><span class="ns">
 </span>only just got out in time. Another moment
and it would have been too big to get through
the door. The audience cheered madly.
They thought it was a clever trick; and so it
would have been, very clever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You silly cuckoo,&rsquo; said Gustus, bitterly,
&lsquo;now you&#8217;ve turned that great thing loose on
the country, and how&#8217;s his keeper to manage
him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I could make the keeper big, too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then if I was you I should just bunk
out and do it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edward obeyed, slipped under the canvas
of the circus tent, and found himself on the
yellow, trampled grass of the field among
guy-ropes, orange-peel, banana-skins, and
dirty paper. Far above him and every one
else towered the elephant&mdash;it was now as big
as the church.</p>

<p>Edward pointed the glass at the man who
was patting the elephant&#8217;s foot&mdash;that was as
far up as he could reach&mdash;and telling it to
&lsquo;Come down with you!&rsquo; He was very
much frightened. He did not know whether
you could be put in prison for making an
elephant&#8217;s keeper about forty times his proper
size. But he felt that something must be done
to control the gigantic mountain of black-lead-coloured
living flesh. So he looked
<a name="png.061" id="png.061"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">40</span><span class="ns">
 </span>at the keeper through the spy-glass, and the
keeper remained his normal size!</p>

<p>In the shock of this failure he dropped the
spy-glass, picked it up, and tried once more
to fix the keeper. Instead he only got a
circle of black-lead-coloured elephant; and
while he was trying to find the keeper, and
finding nothing but more and more of the
elephant, a shout startled him and he dropped
the glass once more. He was a very clumsy
little boy, was Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said one of the men, &lsquo;what a
turn it give me! I thought Jumbo&#8217;d grown as
big as a railway station, s&#8217;welp me if I didn&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now that&#8217;s rum,&rsquo; said another, &lsquo;so did I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And he <em>ain&#8217;t</em>,&rsquo; said a third; &lsquo;seems to me
he&#8217;s a bit below his usual figure. Got a bit
thin or somethink, ain&#8217;t he?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edward slipped back into the tent unobserved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s all right,&rsquo; he whispered to his friend,
&lsquo;he&#8217;s gone back to his proper size, and the
man didn&#8217;t change at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ho!&rsquo; Gustus said slowly&mdash;&lsquo;Ho! All
right. Conjuring&#8217;s a rum thing. You don&#8217;t
never know where you are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t you think you might as well be a
conjurer as a burglar?&rsquo; suggested Edward,
who had had his friend&#8217;s criminal future rather
painfully on his mind for the last hour.</p>

<p><a name="png.062" id="png.062"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">41</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;<em>You</em> might,&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;not me. My
people ain&#8217;t dooks to set me up on any such
a swell lay as conjuring. Now I&#8217;m going to
think, I am. You hold your jaw and look at
the &#8217;andsome Dona a-doin&#8217; of &#8217;er griceful barebacked
hact.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That evening after tea Edward went, as he
had been told to do, to the place on the shore
where the big stones had taught him the magic
of the spy-glass.</p>

<p>Gustus was already at the tryst.</p>

<p>&lsquo;See here,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&#8217;m a-goin&#8217; to do
something brave and fearless, I am, like Lord
Nelson and the boy on the fire-ship. You
out with that spy-glass, an&#8217; I&#8217;ll let you
look at <em>me</em>. Then we&#8217;ll know where we
are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But s&#8217;pose you turn into a giant?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t care. &lsquo;Sides, I shan&#8217;t. T&#8217;other
bloke didn&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;P&#8217;r&#8217;aps,&rsquo; said Edward, cautiously, &lsquo;it only
works by the seashore.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Gustus, reproachfully, &lsquo;you&#8217;ve
been a-trying to think, that&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve been
a-doing. What about the elephant, my emernent
scientister? Now, then!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Very much afraid, Edward pulled out the
glass and looked.</p>

<p>And nothing happened.</p>

<p><a name="png.063" id="png.063"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">42</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;That&#8217;s number one,&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;now,
number two.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He snatched the telescope from Edward&#8217;s
hand, and turned it round and looked through
the other end at the great stones. Edward,
standing by, saw them get smaller and smaller&mdash;turn
to pebbles, to beach, to sand. When
Gustus turned the glass to the giant grass and
flowers on the sea-wall, they also drew back
into themselves, got smaller and smaller, and
presently were as they had been before ever
Edward picked up the magic spy-glass.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now we know all about it&mdash;I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think,&rsquo;
said Gustus. &lsquo;To-morrow we&#8217;ll have a look at
that there model engine of yours that you say
works.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.064" id="png.064"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 width="393" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />It became a quite efficient motor.</p>
</div>

<p>They did. They had a look at it through
the spy-glass, and it became a quite efficient
motor; of rather an odd pattern it is true, and
very bumpy, but capable of quite a decent speed.
They went up to the hills in it, and so odd was
its design that no one who saw it ever forgot it.
People talk about that rummy motor at Bonnington
and Aldington to this day. They
stopped often, to use the spy-glass on various
objects. Trees, for instance, could be made to
grow surprisingly, and there were patches of
giant wheat found that year near Ashford that
were never satisfactorily accounted for. Blackberries,
<a name="png.066" id="png.066"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">43</span><span class="ns">
 </span>too, could be enlarged to a most
wonderful and delicious fruit. And the sudden
growth of a fugitive toffee-drop found in
Edward&#8217;s pocket and placed on the hand
was a happy surprise. When you scraped
the pocket dirt off the outside you had a
pound of delicious toffee. Not so happy was
the incident of the earwig, which crawled into
view when Edward was enlarging a wild strawberry,
and had grown the size of a rat before
the slow but horrified Edward gained courage
to shake it off.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful drive. As they came
home they met a woman driving a weak-looking
little cow. It went by on one side of the
engine and the woman went by on the other.
When they were restored to each other the
cow was nearly the size of a cart-horse, and the
woman did not recognise it. She ran back
along the road after her cow, which must, she
said, have taken fright at the beastly motor.
She scolded violently as she went. So the
boys had to make the cow small again, when
she wasn&#8217;t looking.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This is all very well,&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;but
we&#8217;ve got our fortune to make, I don&#8217;t think.
We&#8217;ve got to get hold of a tanner&mdash;or a bob
would be better.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But this was not possible, because that
<a name="png.067" id="png.067"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">44</span><span class="ns">
 </span>broken window wasn&#8217;t paid for, and Gustus
never had any money.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We ought to be the benefactors of the
human race,&rsquo; said Edward; &lsquo;make all the good
things more and all the bad things less.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And <em>that</em> was all very well&mdash;but the cow
hadn&#8217;t been a great success, as Gustus reminded
him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I see I shall have to do some of my
thinking,&rsquo; he added.</p>

<p>They stopped in a quiet road close by
Dymchurch; the engine was made small again,
and Edward went home with it under his arm.</p>

<p>It was the next day that they found the
shilling on the road. They could hardly
believe their good luck. They went out on
to the shore with it, put it on Edward&#8217;s hand
while Gustus looked at it with the glass, and
the shilling began to grow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s as big as a saucer,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;and
it&#8217;s heavy. I&#8217;ll rest it on these stones. It&#8217;s as
big as a plate; it&#8217;s as big as a tea-tray; it&#8217;s as
big as a cart-wheel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And it was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;we&#8217;ll go and borrow a
cart to take it away. Come on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Edward could not come on. His hand
was in the hollow between the two stones, and
above lay tons of silver. He could not move,
<a name="png.068" id="png.068"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">45</span><span class="ns">
 </span>and the stones couldn&#8217;t move. There was
nothing for it but to look at the great round
lump of silver through the wrong end of the
spy-glass till it got small enough for Edward
to lift it. And then, unfortunately, Gustus
looked a little too long, and the shilling, having
gone back to its own size, went a little further&mdash;and
it went to sixpenny size, and then went
out altogether.</p>

<p>So nobody got anything by that.</p>

<p>And now came the time when, as was to be
expected, Edward dropped the telescope in his
aunt&#8217;s presence. She said, &lsquo;What&#8217;s that?&rsquo;
picked it up with quite unfair quickness, and
looked through it, and through the open window
at a fishing-boat, which instantly swelled to the
size of a man-of-war.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My goodness! what a strong glass!&rsquo; said
the aunt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Isn&#8217;t it?&rsquo; said Edward, gently taking it
from her. He looked at the ship through the
glass&#8217;s other end till she got to her proper size
again and then smaller. He just stopped in
time to prevent its disappearing altogether.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll take care of it for you,&rsquo; said the aunt.
And for the first time in their lives Edward
said &lsquo;No&rsquo; to his aunt.</p>

<p>It was a terrible moment.</p>

<p>Edward, quite frenzied by his own courage,
<a name="png.069" id="png.069"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">46</span><span class="ns">
 </span>turned the glass on one object after another&mdash;the
furniture grew as he looked, and when
he lowered the glass the aunt was pinned
fast between a monster table-leg and a great
chiffonier.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Edward. &lsquo;And I shan&#8217;t let
you out till you say you won&#8217;t take it to take
care of either.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, have it your own way,&rsquo; said the
aunt, faintly, and closed her eyes. When she
opened them the furniture was its right size
and Edward was gone. He had twinges of
conscience, but the aunt never mentioned the
subject again. I have reason to suppose that
<em>she</em> supposed that she had had a fit of an
unusual and alarming nature.</p>

<p>Next day the boys in the camp were to go
back to their slums. Edward and Gustus
parted on the seashore and Edward cried.
He had never met a boy whom he liked as
he liked Gustus. And Gustus himself was
almost melted.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will say for you you&#8217;re more like a man
and less like a snivelling white rabbit now than
what you was when I met you. Well, we
ain&#8217;t done nothing to speak of with that there
conjuring trick of yours, but we&#8217;ve &#8217;ad a right
good time. So long. See you &#8217;gain some
day.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.070" id="png.070"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">47</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Edward hesitated, spluttered, and still weeping
flung his arms round Gustus.</p>

<p>&lsquo;&lsquo;Ere, none o&#8217; that,&rsquo; said Gustus, sternly.
&lsquo;If you ain&#8217;t man enough to know better, I am.
Shake &#8217;ands like a Briton; right about face&mdash;and
part game.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He suited the action to the word.</p>

<p>Edward went back to his aunt snivelling,
defenceless but happy. He had never had a
friend except Gustus, and now he had given
Gustus the greatest treasure that he possessed.</p>

<p>For Edward was not such a white rabbit as
he seemed. And in that last embrace he had
managed to slip the little telescope into the
pocket of the reefer coat which Gustus wore,
ready for his journey.</p>

<p>It was the greatest treasure that Edward
had, but it was also the greatest responsibility,
so that while he felt the joy of self-sacrifice he
also felt the rapture of relief. Life is full of
such mixed moments.</p>

<p>And the holidays ended and Edward went
back to his villa. Be sure he had given Gustus
his home address, and begged him to write, but
Gustus never did.</p>

<p>Presently Edward&#8217;s father came home from
India, and they left his aunt to her villa and
went to live at a jolly little house on a sloping
hill at Chiselhurst, which was Edward&#8217;s father&#8217;s
<a name="png.071" id="png.071"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">48</span><span class="ns">
 </span>very own. They were not rich, and Edward
could not go to a very good school, and though
there was enough to eat and wear, what there
was was very plain. And Edward&#8217;s father had
been wounded, and somehow had not got a
pension.</p>

<p>Now one night in the next summer Edward
woke up in his bed with the feeling that there
was some one in the room. And there was.
A dark figure was squeezing itself through the
window. Edward was far too frightened to
scream. He simply lay and listened to his
heart. It was like listening to a cheap American
clock. The next moment a lantern flashed in
his eyes and a masked face bent over him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where does your father keep his money?&rsquo;
said a muffled voice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;In the b-b-b-b-bank,&rsquo; replied the wretched
Edward, truthfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I mean what he&#8217;s got in the house.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In his trousers pocket,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;only
he puts it in the dressing-table drawer at night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must go and get it,&rsquo; said the burglar,
for such he plainly was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Must I?&rsquo; said Edward, wondering how
he could get out of betraying his father&#8217;s confidence
and being branded as a criminal.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the burglar in an awful voice,
&lsquo;get up and go.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.072" id="png.072"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">49</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;<em>No</em>,&rsquo; said Edward, and he was as much
surprised at his courage as you are.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bravo!&rsquo; said the burglar, flinging off his
mask. &lsquo;I see you <em>aren&#8217;t</em> such a white rabbit
as what I thought you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s Gustus,&rsquo; said Edward. &lsquo;Oh, Gustus,
I&#8217;m so glad! Oh, Gustus, I&#8217;m so sorry! I
always hoped you wouldn&#8217;t be a burglar. And
now you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am so,&rsquo; said Gustus, with pride, &lsquo;but,&rsquo; he
added sadly, &lsquo;this is my first burglary.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Couldn&#8217;t it be the last?&rsquo; suggested Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That,&rsquo; replied Gustus, &lsquo;depends on you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll do anything,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You see,&rsquo; said Gustus, sitting down on the
edge of the bed in a confidential attitude, with
the dark lantern in one hand and the mask in
the other, &lsquo;when you&#8217;re as hard up as we are,
there&#8217;s not much of a living to be made honest.
I&#8217;m sure I wonder we don&#8217;t all of us turn
burglars, so I do. And that glass of yours&mdash;you
little beggar&mdash;you did me proper&mdash;sticking
of that thing in my pocket like what you did.
Well, it kept us alive last winter, that&#8217;s a cert.
I used to look at the victuals with it, like what
I said I would. A farden&#8217;s worth o&#8217; pease-pudden
was a dinner for three when that glass
was about, and a penn&#8217;orth o&#8217; scraps turned into
a big beef-steak almost. They used to wonder
<a name="png.073" id="png.073"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">50</span><span class="ns">
 </span>how I got so much for the money. But I&#8217;m
always afraid o&#8217; being found out&mdash;or of losing
the blessed spy-glass&mdash;or of some one pinching
it. So we got to do what I always said&mdash;make
some use of it. And if I go along and nick
your father&#8217;s dibs we&#8217;ll make our fortunes right
away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;but I&#8217;ll ask father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Rot.&rsquo; Gustus was crisp and contemptuous.
&lsquo;He&#8217;d think you was off your chump, and he&#8217;d
get me lagged.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would be stealing,&rsquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not when you&#8217;ll pay it back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, it would,&rsquo; said Edward. &lsquo;Oh, don&#8217;t
ask me&mdash;I can&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I shall,&rsquo; said Gustus. &lsquo;Where&#8217;s his
room.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&#8217;t!&rsquo; said Edward. &lsquo;I&#8217;ve got a
half-sovereign of my own. I&#8217;ll give you that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lawk!&rsquo; said Gustus. &lsquo;Why the blue
monkeys couldn&#8217;t you say so? Come on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He pulled Edward out of bed by the leg,
hurried his clothes on anyhow, and half-dragged,
half-coaxed him through the window and down
by the ivy and the chicken-house roof.</p>

<p>They stood face to face in the sloping
garden and Edward&#8217;s teeth chattered. Gustus
caught him by his hand, and led him away.</p>

<p>At the other end of the shrubbery, where
<a name="png.074" id="png.074"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">51</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the rockery was, Gustus stooped and dragged
out a big clinker&mdash;then another, and another.
There was a hole like a big rabbit-hole. If
Edward had really been a white rabbit it
would just have fitted him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll go first,&rsquo; said Gustus, and went, head-foremost.
&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; he said, hollowly,
from inside. And Edward, too, went. It
was dreadful crawling into that damp hole in
the dark. As his head got through the hole
he saw that it led to a cave, and below him
stood a dark figure. The lantern was on the
ground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said Gustus, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll catch you
if you fall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>With a rush and a scramble Edward got
in.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s caves,&rsquo; said Gustus. &lsquo;A chap I know
that goes about the country bottoming cane-chairs,
&#8217;e told me about it. And I nosed
about and found he lived here. So then I
thought what a go. So now we&#8217;ll put your
half-shiner down and look at it, and we&#8217;ll
have a gold-mine, and you can pretend to
find it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Halves!&rsquo; said Edward, briefly and firmly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re a man,&rsquo; said Gustus. &lsquo;Now,
then!&rsquo; He led the way through a maze of
chalk caves till they came to a convenient
<a name="png.075" id="png.075"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">52</span><span class="ns">
 </span>spot, which he had marked. And now
Edward emptied his pockets on the sand&mdash;he
had brought all the contents of his money-box,
and there was more silver than gold,
and more copper than either, and more odd
rubbish than there was anything else. You
know what a boy&#8217;s pockets are like. Stones
and putty, and slate-pencils and marbles&mdash;I
urge in excuse that Edward was a very
little boy&mdash;a bit of plasticine, one or two bits
of wood.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No time to sort &#8217;em,&rsquo; said Gustus, and,
putting the lantern in a suitable position, he
got out the glass and began to look through it
at the tumbled heap.</p>

<p>And the heap began to grow. It grew out
sideways till it touched the walls of the
recess, and outwards till it touched the top of
the recess, and then it slowly worked out
into the big cave and came nearer and nearer
to the boys. Everything grew&mdash;stones, putty,
money, wood, plasticine.</p>

<p>Edward patted the growing mass as though
it were alive and he loved it, and Gustus said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here&#8217;s clothes, and beef, and bread, and
tea, and coffee&mdash;and baccy&mdash;and a good
school, and me a engineer. I see it all
a-growing and a-growing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hi&mdash;stop!&rsquo; said Edward suddenly.</p>

<p><a name="png.076" id="png.076"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">53</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Gustus dropped the telescope. It rolled
away into the darkness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now you&#8217;ve done it,&rsquo; said Edward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; said Gustus.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My hand,&rsquo; said Edward, &lsquo;it&#8217;s fast between
the rock and the gold and things. Find the
glass and make it go smaller so that I can get
my hand out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Gustus could not find the glass. And,
what is more, no one ever has found it to this
day.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s no good,&rsquo; said Gustus, at last. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll go
and find your father. They must come and
dig you out of this precious Tom Tiddler&#8217;s
ground.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And they&#8217;ll lag you if they see you. You
said they would,&rsquo; said Edward, not at all sure
what lagging was, but sure that it was something
dreadful. &lsquo;Write a letter and put it in
his letter-box. They&#8217;ll find it in the morning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And leave you pinned by the hand all
night? Likely&mdash;I <em>don&#8217;t</em> think,&rsquo; said Gustus.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;d rather,&rsquo; said Edward, bravely, but his
voice was weak. &lsquo;I couldn&#8217;t bear you to be
lagged, Gustus. I do love you so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;None of that,&rsquo; said Gustus, sternly. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll
leave you the lamp; I can find my way with
matches. Keep up your pecker, and never

 /></span>&lsquo;I won&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Edward, bravely. &lsquo;Oh,
Gustus!&rsquo;</p>


<p class="tb"><br class="ns"/>That was how it happened that Edward&#8217;s
father was roused from slumbers by violent
shakings from an unknown hand, while an
unknown voice uttered these surprising
words:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Edward is in the gold and silver and
copper mine that we&#8217;ve found under your
garden. Come and get him out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When Edward&#8217;s father was at last persuaded
that Gustus was not a silly dream&mdash;and this
took some time&mdash;he got up.</p>

<p>He did not believe a word that Gustus said,
even when Gustus added &lsquo;S&#8217;welp me!&rsquo; which
he did several times.</p>

<p>But Edward&#8217;s bed was empty&mdash;his clothes
gone.</p>

<p>Edward&#8217;s father got the gardener from next
door&mdash;with, at the suggestion of Gustus, a pick&mdash;the
hole in the rockery was enlarged, and
they all got in.</p>

<p>And when they got to the place where
Edward was, there, sure enough, was Edward,
pinned by the hand between a piece of wood
and a piece of rock. Neither the father nor
the gardener noticed any metal. Edward had
fainted.</p>

<p><a name="png.078" id="png.078"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">55</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>They got him out; a couple of strokes with
the pick released his hand, but it was bruised
and bleeding.</p>

<p>They all turned to go, but they had not
gone twenty yards before there was a crash
and a loud report like thunder, and a slow
rumbling, rattling noise very dreadful to
hear.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Get out of this quick, sir,&rsquo; said the gardener;
&lsquo;the roof&#8217;s fell in; this part of the
caves ain&#8217;t safe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Edward was very feverish and ill for several
days, during which he told his father the whole
story&mdash;of which his father did not believe a
word. But he was kind to Gustus, because
Gustus was evidently fond of Edward.</p>

<p>When Edward was well enough to walk
in the garden his father and he found that a
good deal of the shrubbery had sunk, so that
the trees looked as though they were growing
in a pit.</p>

<p>It spoiled the look of the garden, and
Edward&#8217;s father decided to move the trees to
the other side.</p>

<p>When this was done the first tree uprooted
showed a dark hollow below it. The man is
not born who will not examine and explore a
dark hollow in his own grounds. So Edward&#8217;s
father explored.</p>

<p><a name="png.079" id="png.079"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">56</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>This is the true story of the discovery of
that extraordinary vein of silver, copper, and
gold which has excited so much interest in
scientific and mining circles. Learned papers
have been written about it, learned professors
have been rude to each other about it, but no
one knows how it came there except Gustus
and Edward and you and me. Edward&#8217;s father
is quite as ignorant as any one else, but he is
much richer than most of them; and, at any
rate, he knows that it was Gustus who first told
him of the gold-mine, and who risked being
lagged&mdash;arrested by the police, that is&mdash;rather
than let Edward wait till morning with his
hand fast between wood and rock.</p>

<p>So Edward and Gustus have been to a
good school, and now they are at Winchester,
and presently they will be at Oxford. And
when Gustus is twenty-one he will have half
the money that came from the gold-mine.
And then he and Edward mean to start a
school of their own. And the boys who are to
go to it are to be the sort of boys who go to
the summer camp of the Grand Redoubt near
the sea&mdash;the kind of boy that Gustus was.</p>

<p>So the spy-glass will do some good after
all, though it <em>was</em> so unmanageable to begin
with.</p>

<p>Perhaps it may even be found again. But
<a name="png.080" id="png.080"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">57</span><span class="ns">
 </span>I rather hope it won&#8217;t. It might, really, have
done much more mischief than it did&mdash;and if
any one found it, it might do more yet.</p>

 />ACCIDENTAL MAGIC; OR DON&#8217;T
   TELL <span class="nw">ALL YOU KNOW</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Quentin de Ward</span> was rather a nice little boy,
but he had never been with other little boys,
and that made him in some ways a little different
from other little boys. His father was in India,
and he and his mother lived in a little house in
the New Forest. The house&mdash;it was a cottage
really, but even a cottage is a house, isn&#8217;t it?&mdash;was
very pretty and thatched and had a porch
covered with honeysuckle and ivy and white
roses, and straight red hollyhocks were trained
to stand up in a row against the south wall of
it. The two lived quite alone, and as they had
no one else to talk to they talked to each other
a good deal. Mrs. de Ward read a great many
books, and she used to tell Quentin about them
afterwards. They were usually books about
out of the way things, for Mrs. de Ward was
interested in all the things that people are not
quite sure about&mdash;the things that are hidden
<a name="png.084" id="png.084"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">59</span><span class="ns">
 </span>and secret, wonderful and mysterious&mdash;the
things people make discoveries about. So that
when the two were having their tea on the little
brick terrace in front of the hollyhocks, with
the white cloth flapping in the breeze, and the
wasps hovering round the jam-pot, it was no
uncommon thing for Quentin to say thickly
through his bread and jam:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say, mother, tell me some more about
Atlantis.&rsquo; Or, &lsquo;Mother, tell me some more
about ancient Egypt and the little toy-boats
they made for their little boys.&rsquo; Or, &lsquo;Mother,
tell me about the people who think Lord Bacon
wrote Shakespeare.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And his mother always told him as much
as she thought he could understand, and he
always understood quite half of what she told
him.</p>

<p>They always talked the things out thoroughly,
and thus he learned to be fond of arguing, and
to enjoy using his brains, just as you enjoy
using your muscles in the football field or the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>Also he came to know quite a lot of odd,
out of the way things, and to have opinions of
his own concerning the lost Kingdom of
Atlantis, and the Man with the Iron Mask,
the building of Stonehenge, the Pre-dynastic
Egyptians, cuneiform writings and Assyrian
<a name="png.085" id="png.085"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">60</span><span class="ns">
 </span>sculptures, the Mexican pyramids and the
shipping activities of Tyre and Sidon.</p>

<p>Quentin did no regular lessons, such as most
boys have, but he read all sorts of books and
made notes from them, in a large and straggling
handwriting.</p>

<p>You will already have supposed that Quentin
was a prig. But he wasn&#8217;t, and you would
have owned this if you had seen him scampering
through the greenwood on his quiet New
Forest pony, or setting snares for the rabbits
that <em>would</em> get into the garden and eat the
precious lettuces and parsley. Also he fished
in the little streams that run through that lovely
land, and shot with a bow and arrows. And
he was a very good shot too.</p>

<p>Besides this he collected stamps and birds&#8217;
eggs and picture post-cards, and kept guinea-pigs
and bantams, and climbed trees and tore his
clothes in twenty different ways. And once he
fought the grocer&#8217;s boy and got licked and didn&#8217;t
cry, and made friends with the grocer&#8217;s boy
afterwards, and got him to show him all he
knew about fighting, so you see he was really not
a mug. He was ten years old and he had
enjoyed every moment of his ten years, even
the sleeping ones, because he always dreamed
jolly dreams, though he could not always
remember what they were.</p>

<p><a name="png.086" id="png.086"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">61</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>I tell you all this so that you may understand
why he said what he did when his
mother broke the news to him.</p>

<p>He was sitting by the stream that ran along
the end of the garden, making bricks of the
clay that the stream&#8217;s banks were made of. He
dried them in the sun, and then baked them
under the kitchen stove. (It is quite a good
way to make bricks&mdash;you might try it sometimes.)
His mother came out, looking just as
usual, in her pink cotton gown and her pink
sunbonnet; and she had a letter in her hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hullo, boy of my heart,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;very
busy?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Quentin importantly, not looking
up, and going on with his work. &lsquo;I&#8217;m making
stones to build Stonehenge with. You&#8217;ll show
me how to build it, won&#8217;t you, mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear,&rsquo; she said absently. &lsquo;Yes, if I
can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you can,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you can do
everything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She sat down on a tuft of grass near him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quentin dear,&rsquo; she said, and something in
her voice made him look up suddenly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, mother, what is it?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Daddy&#8217;s been wounded,&rsquo; she said; &lsquo;he&#8217;s all
right now, dear&mdash;don&#8217;t be frightened. Only
I&#8217;ve got to go out to him. I shall meet him in
<a name="png.087" id="png.087"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">62</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Egypt. And you must go to school in Salisbury,
a very nice school, dear, till I come back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can&#8217;t I come too?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>And when he understood that he could not
he went on with the bricks in silence, with his
mouth shut very tight.</p>

<p>After a moment he said, &lsquo;Salisbury? Then
I shall see Stonehenge?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said his mother, pleased that he took
the news so calmly, &lsquo;you will be sure to see
Stonehenge some time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He stood still, looking down at the little
mould of clay in his hand&mdash;so still that his
mother got up and came close to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quentin,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;darling, what is it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He leaned his head against her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I won&#8217;t make a fuss,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;but you can&#8217;t
begin to be brave the very first minute. Or, if
you do, you can&#8217;t go on being.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with that he began to cry, though he
had not cried after the affair of the grocer&#8217;s boy.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>The thought of school was not so terrible to
Quentin as Mrs. de Ward had thought it
would be. In fact, he rather liked it, with half
his mind; but the other half didn&#8217;t like it,
because it meant parting from his mother who,
so far, had been his only friend. But it was
exciting to be taken to Southampton, and have
<a name="png.088" id="png.088"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">63</span><span class="ns">
 </span>all sorts of new clothes bought for you, and a
school trunk, and a little polished box that
locked up, to keep your money in and your
gold sleeve links, and your watch and chain
when you were not wearing them.</p>

<p>Also the journey to Salisbury was made in
a motor, which was very exciting of course, and
rather took Quentin&#8217;s mind off the parting with
his mother, as she meant it should. And there
was a very grand lunch at The White Hart
Hotel at Salisbury, and then, very suddenly
indeed, it was good-bye, good-bye, and the
motor snorted, and hooted, and throbbed, and
rushed away, and mother was gone, and Quentin
was at school.</p>

<p>I believe it was quite a nice school. It was
in a very nice house with a large quiet garden,
and there were only about twenty boys. And
the masters were kind, and the boys no worse
than other boys of their age. But Quentin hated
it from the very beginning. For when his
mother had gone the Headmaster said:
&lsquo;School will be out in half-an-hour; take a
book, <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'De Ward'">de Ward</ins>,&rsquo; and gave him <cite>Little Eric and
his Friends</cite>, a mere baby book. It was too
silly. He could not read it. He saw on a
shelf near him, <cite>Smith&#8217;s Antiquities</cite>, a very old
friend of his, so he said: &lsquo;I&#8217;d rather have this,
please.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.089" id="png.089"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">64</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;You should say &ldquo;sir&rdquo; when you speak to a
master,&rsquo; the Head said to him. &lsquo;Take the
book by all means.&rsquo; To himself the Head
said, &lsquo;I wish you joy of it, you little prig.&rsquo;</p>

<p>When school was over, one of the boys was
told to show Quentin his bed and his locker.
The matron had already unpacked his box and
his pile of books was waiting for him to carry
it over.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Golly, what a lot of books,&rsquo; said Smithson
minor. &lsquo;What&#8217;s this? <cite>Atlantis</cite>? Is it a jolly
story?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It isn&#8217;t a story,&rsquo; said Quentin. And just
then the classical master came by. &lsquo;What&#8217;s
that about <cite>Atlantis</cite>?&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s a book the new chap&#8217;s got,&rsquo; said
Smithson.</p>

<p>The classical master glanced at the book.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And how much do you understand of this?&rsquo;
he asked, fluttering the leaves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nearly all, I think,&rsquo; said Quentin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should say &ldquo;sir&rdquo; when you speak to a
master,&rsquo; said the classical one; and to himself
he added, &lsquo;little prig.&rsquo; Then he said to
Quentin: &lsquo;I am afraid you will find yourself
rather out of your element among ordinary
boys.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t think so,&rsquo; said Quentin calmly,
adding as an afterthought &lsquo;sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.090" id="png.090"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">65</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re so confident,&rsquo; said the
classical master and went.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My word,&rsquo; said Smithson minor in a rather
awed voice, &lsquo;you did answer him back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course I did,&rsquo; said Quentin. &lsquo;Don&#8217;t
<em>you</em> answer when you&#8217;re spoken to?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Smithson minor informed the interested
school that the new chap was a prig, but he
had a cool cheek, and that some sport might be
expected.</p>

<p>After supper the boys had half an hour&#8217;s
recreation. Quentin, who was tired, picked up
a book which a big boy had just put down.
It was the <cite>Midsummer Night&#8217;s Dream</cite>.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hi, you kid,&rsquo; said the big boy, &lsquo;don&#8217;t
pretend you read Shakespeare for fun. That&#8217;s
simple swank, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t know what swank is,&rsquo; said Quentin,
&lsquo;but I like the <cite>Midsummer</cite> whoever wrote it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whoever <em>what</em>?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Quentin, &lsquo;there&#8217;s a good deal
to be said for its being Bacon who wrote the
plays.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of course that settled it. From that moment,
he was called not <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'De Ward'">de Ward</ins>, which was strange
enough, but Bacon. He rather liked that.
But the next day it was Pork, and the day after
Pig, and that was unbearable.</p>

<p>He was at the bottom of his class, for he
<a name="png.091" id="png.091"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">66</span><span class="ns">
 </span>knew no Latin as it is taught in schools, only
odd words that English words come from, and
some Latin words that are used in science.
And I cannot pretend that his arithmetic was
anything but contemptible.</p>

<p>The book called <cite>Atlantis</cite> had been looked
at by most of the school, and Smithson major,
not nearly such an agreeable boy as his brother,
hit on a new nickname.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Atlantic Pork&#8217;s a good name for a swanker,&rsquo;
he said. &lsquo;You know the rotten meat they
have in Chicago.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was in the playground before dinner.
Quentin, who had to keep his mouth shut very
tight these days, because, of course, a boy of ten
cannot cry before other chaps, shut the book
he was reading and looked up.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I won&#8217;t be called that,&rsquo; he said quietly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who said you wouldn&#8217;t?&rsquo; said Smithson
major, who, after all, was only twelve. &lsquo;I say
you will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you call me that I shall hit you,&rsquo; said
Quentin, &lsquo;as hard as I can.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A roar of laughter went up, and cries of,
&lsquo;Poor old Smithson&rsquo;&mdash;&lsquo;Apologise, Smithie, and
leave the omnibus.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what should I <ins class="TN" title="Transciber's note:
 original reads 'being'">be</ins> doing while you
were hitting me?&rsquo; asked Smithson contemptuously.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.093" id="png.093"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">opp p67</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-093.png"
 width="650" height="478" alt="" title="" /><br
 />It landed on the point of the chin of Smithson major.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="png.094" id="png.094"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">67</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t know and I don&#8217;t care,&rsquo; said
Quentin.</p>

<p>Smithson looked round. No master was in
sight. It seemed an excellent opportunity to
teach young <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'De Ward'">de Ward</ins> his place.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Atlantic pig-swine,&rsquo; he said very deliberately.
And Quentin sprang at him, and
instantly it was a fight.</p>

<p>Now Quentin had only once fought&mdash;really
fought&mdash;before. Then it was the grocer&#8217;s boy
and he had been beaten. But he had learned
something since. And the chief conclusion he
now drew from his memories of that fight was
that he had not hit half hard enough, an opinion
almost universal among those who have fought
and not won.</p>

<p>As the fist of Smithson major described a
half circle and hurt his ear very much, Quentin
suddenly screwed himself up and hit out with
his right hand, straight, and with his whole
weight behind the blow as the grocer&#8217;s boy had
shown him. All his grief for his wounded
father, his sorrow at the parting from his mother,
all his hatred of his school, and his contempt for
his schoolfellows went into that blow. It landed
on the point of the chin of Smithson major who
fell together like a heap of rags.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Quentin, gazing with interest
at his hand&mdash;it hurt a good deal but he
<a name="png.095" id="png.095"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">68</span><span class="ns">
 </span>looked at it with respect&mdash;&lsquo;I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;ve hurt
him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had forgotten for a moment that he was
in an enemies&#8217; country, and so, apparently, had
his enemies.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well done, Piggy! Bravo, young &#8217;un!
Well hit, by Jove!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Friendly hands thumped him on the back.
Smithson major was no popular hero.</p>

<p>Quentin felt&mdash;as his schoolfellows would
have put it&mdash;bucked. It is one thing to be
called Pig in enmity and derision. Another to
be called Piggy&mdash;an affectionate diminutive,
after all&mdash;to the chorus of admiring smacks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Get up, Smithie,&rsquo; cried the ring. &lsquo;Want
any more?&rsquo;</p>

<p>It appeared that Smithie did not want any
more. He lay, not moving at all, and very
white.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; the crowd&#8217;s temper veered, &lsquo;you&#8217;ve
killed him, I expect. I wouldn&#8217;t like to be
you, Bacon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Pig, you notice, for aggravation&mdash;Piggy in
enthusiastic applause. In the moment of possible
tragedy the more formal Bacon.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I haven&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Quentin, very white himself,
&lsquo;but if I have he began&mdash;by calling
names.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Smithson moved and grunted. A sigh of
<a name="png.096" id="png.096"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">69</span><span class="ns">
 </span>relief swept the ring as a breeze sweeps a
cornfield.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s all right. A fair knock out. Piggy&#8217;s
got the use of &#8217;em. Do Smithie good.&rsquo; The
voices hushed suddenly. A master was on the
scene&mdash;the classical master.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fighting?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The new boy? Who
began it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I did,&rsquo; said Quentin, &lsquo;but he began with
calling names.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sneak!&rsquo; murmured the entire school, and
Quentin, who had seen no reason for not
speaking the truth, perceived that one should
not tell all one knows, and that once more he
stood alone in the world.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will go to your room, <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'De Ward'">de Ward</ins>,&rsquo; said
the classical master, bending over Smithson,
who having been &lsquo;knocked silly&rsquo; still remained
in that condition, &lsquo;and the headmaster will consider
your case to-morrow. You will probably
be expelled.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Quentin went to his room and thought over
his position. It seemed to be desperate. How
was he to know that the classical master was
even then saying to the Head:</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s got something in him, prig or no
prig, sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You were quite right to send him to his
room,&rsquo; said the Head, &lsquo;discipline must be
<a name="png.097" id="png.097"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">70</span><span class="ns">
 </span>maintained, as Mr. Ducket says. But it will
do Smithson major a world of good. A boy
who reads Shakespeare for fun, and has views
about Atlantis, and can knock out a bully as
well&hellip;. He&#8217;ll be a power in the school.
But we mustn&#8217;t let him know it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>That was rather a pity. Because Quentin,
furious at the injustice of the whole thing&mdash;Smithson,
the aggressor, consoled with; himself
punished; expulsion threatened&mdash;was
maturing plans.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If mother had known what it was like,&rsquo; he
said to himself, &lsquo;she would never have left me
here. I&#8217;ve got the two pounds she gave me.
I shall go to the White Hart at Salisbury
&hellip; no, they&#8217;d find me then. I&#8217;ll go to Lyndhurst;
and write to her. It&#8217;s better to run
away than to be expelled. Quentin Durward
would never have waited to be expelled from
anywhere.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of course Quentin Durward was my hero&#8217;s
hero. It could not be otherwise since his own
name was so like that of the Scottish guardsman.</p>

<p>Now the school in Salisbury was a little
school for little boys&mdash;boys who were used to
schools and took the rough with the smooth.
But Quentin was not used to schools, and he
had taken the rough very much to heart. So
<a name="png.098" id="png.098"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">71</span><span class="ns">
 </span>much that he did not mean to take any more
of it.</p>

<p>His dinner was brought up on a tray&mdash;bread
and water. He put the bread in his pocket.
Then when he knew that every one was at
dinner in the long dining-room at the back of
the house, he just walked very quietly down
the stairs, opened the side door and marched
out, down the garden path and out at the tradesmen&#8217;s
gate. He knew better than to shut
either gate or door.</p>

<p>He went quickly down the street, turned
the first corner he came to so as to get out of
sight of the school. He turned another corner,
went through an archway, and found himself
in an inn-yard&mdash;very quiet indeed. Only a
liver-coloured lurcher dog wagged a sleepy tail
on the hot flag-stones.</p>

<p>Quentin was just turning to go back through
the arch, for there was no other way out of the
yard, when he saw a big covered cart, whose
horse wore a nose-bag and looked as if there
was no hurry. The cart bore the name, &lsquo;Miles,
Carrier, Lyndhurst.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Quentin knew all about lifts. He had often
begged them and got them. Now there was
no one to ask. But he felt he could very well
explain later that he had wanted a lift, much
better than now, in fact, when he might be
<a name="png.099" id="png.099"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">72</span><span class="ns">
 </span>caught at any moment by some one from the
school.</p>

<p>He climbed up by the shaft. There were
boxes and packages of all sorts in the cart, and
at the back an empty crate with sacking over
it. He got into the crate, pulled the sacking
over himself, and settled down to eat his bread.</p>

<p>Presently the carrier came out, and there
was talk, slow, long-drawn talk. After a long
while the cart shook to the carrier&#8217;s heavy
climb into it, the harness rattled, the cart
lurched, and the wheels were loud and bumpy
over the cobble stones of the yard.</p>

<p>Quentin felt safe. The glow of anger was
still hot in him, and he was glad to think how
they would look for him all over the town, in
vain. He lifted the sacking at one corner so
that he could look out between the canvas of
the cart&#8217;s back and side, and hoped to see the
classical master distractedly looking for him.
But the streets were very sleepy. Every one
in Salisbury was having dinner&mdash;or in the case
of the affluent, lunch.</p>

<p>The black horse seemed as sleepy as the
streets, and went very slowly. Also it stopped
very often, and wherever there were parcels to
leave there was slow, long talkings to be exchanged.
I think, perhaps, Quentin dozed a
good deal under his sacks. At any rate it was
<a name="png.100" id="png.100"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">73</span><span class="ns">
 </span>with a shock of surprise that he suddenly heard
the carrier&#8217;s voice saying, as the horse stopped
with a jerk:</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&#8217;s a crate for you, Mrs. Baddock,
returned empty,&rsquo; and knew that that crate was
not empty, but full&mdash;full of boy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll go and call Joe,&rsquo; said a voice&mdash;Mrs.
Baddock&#8217;s, Quentin supposed, and slow feet
stumped away over stones. Mr. Miles leisurely
untied the tail of the cart, ready to let the crate
be taken out.</p>

<p>Quentin spent a paralytic moment. What
could he do?</p>

<p>And then, luckily or unluckily, a reckless
motor tore past, and the black horse plunged
and Mr. Miles had to go to its head and &lsquo;talk
pretty&rsquo; to it for a minute. And in that minute
Quentin lifted the sacking, and looked out. It
was low sunset, and the street was deserted.
He stepped out of the crate, dropped to the
ground, and slipped behind a stout and friendly
water-butt that seemed to offer protective
shelter.</p>

<p>Joe came, and the crate was taken down.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You haven&#8217;t seen nothing of that there
runaway boy by chance?&rsquo; said a new voice&mdash;Joe&#8217;s
no doubt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What boy?&rsquo; said Mr. Miles.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Run away from school, Salisbury,&rsquo; said
<a name="png.101" id="png.101"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">74</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Joe. &lsquo;Telegrams far and near, so they be.
Little varmint.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I ain&#8217;t seen no boys, not more&#8217;n ordinary,&rsquo;
said Mr. Miles. &lsquo;Thick as flies they be, here,
there, and everywhere, drat &#8217;em. Sixpence&mdash;Correct.
So long, Joe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The cart rattled away. Joe and the crate
blundered out of hearing, and Quentin looked
cautiously round the water-butt.</p>

<p>This was an adventure. But he was cooler
now than he had been at starting&mdash;his hot
anger had died down. He would have been
contented, he could not help feeling, with a less
adventurous adventure.</p>

<p>But he was in for it now. He felt, as I
suppose people feel when they jump off cliffs
with parachutes, that return was impossible.</p>

<p>Hastily turning his school cap inside out&mdash;the
only disguise he could think of, he emerged
from the water-butt seclusion and into the
street, trying to look as if there was no reason
why he should not be there. He did not know
the village. It was not Lyndhurst. And of
course asking the way was not to be thought of.</p>

<p>There was a piece of sacking lying on the
road; it must have dropped from the carrier&#8217;s
cart. He picked it up and put it over his
shoulders.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A deeper disguise,&rsquo; he said, and walked on.</p>

<p><a name="png.102" id="png.102"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">75</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He walked steadily for a long, long way as
it seemed, and the world got darker and
darker. But he kept on. Surely he must
presently come to some village, or some
signpost.</p>

<p>Anyhow, whatever happened, he could not
go back. That was the one certain thing.
The broad stretches of country to right and
left held no shapes of houses, no glimmer of
warm candle-light; they were bare and bleak,
only broken by circles of trees that stood out
like black islands in the misty grey of the
twilight.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall have to sleep behind a hedge,&rsquo; he
said bravely enough; but there did not seem
to be any hedges. And then, quite suddenly,
he came upon it.</p>

<p>A scattered building, half transparent as it
seemed, showing black against the last faint
pink and primrose of the sunset. He stopped,
took a few steps off the road on short, crisp
turf that rose in a gentle slope. And at the
end of a dozen paces he knew it. Stonehenge!
Stonehenge he had always wanted so
desperately to see. Well, he saw it now, more
or less.</p>

<p>He stopped to think. He knew that Stonehenge
stands all alone on Salisbury Plain. He
was very tired. His mother had told him
<a name="png.103" id="png.103"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">76</span><span class="ns">
 </span>about a girl in a book who slept all night on the
altar stone at Stonehenge. So it was a thing
that people did&mdash;to sleep there. He was not
afraid, as you or I might have been&mdash;of that
lonely desolate ruin of a temple of long ago.
He was used to the forest, and, compared with
the forest, any building is homelike.</p>

<p>There was just enough light left amid the
stones of the wonderful broken circle to guide
him to its centre. As he went his hand brushed
a plant; he caught at it, and a little group of
flowers came away in his hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;St. John&#8217;s wort,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that&#8217;s the magic
flower.&rsquo; And he remembered that it is only
magic when you pluck it on Midsummer Eve.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And this <em>is</em> Midsummer Eve,&rsquo; he told
himself, and put it in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t know where the altar stone is,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;but that looks a cosy little crack between
those two big stones.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He crept into it, and lay down on a flat
stone that stretched between and under two
fallen pillars.</p>

<p>The night was soft and warm; it was Midsummer
Eve.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother isn&#8217;t going till the twenty-sixth,&rsquo; he
told himself. &lsquo;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t bother about hotels. I
shall send her a telegram in the morning, and
get a carriage at the nearest stables and go
<a name="png.104" id="png.104"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">77</span><span class="ns">
 </span>straight back to her. No, she won&#8217;t be angry
when she hears all about it. I&#8217;ll ask her to let
me go to sea instead of to school. It&#8217;s much
more manly. Much more manly &hellip; much
much more, much.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was asleep. And the wild west wind
that swept across the plain spared the little
corner where he lay asleep, curled up in his
sacking with the inside-out school cap, doubled
twice, for pillow.</p>

<p>He fell asleep on the smooth, solid, steady
stone.</p>

<p>He awoke on the stone in a world that
rocked as sea-boats rock on a choppy sea.</p>

<p>He went to sleep between fallen moveless
pillars of a ruin older than any world that
history knows.</p>

<p>He awoke in the shade of a purple awning
through which strong sunlight filtered, and
purple curtains that flapped and strained in the
wind; and there was a smell, a sweet familiar
smell, of tarred ropes and the sea.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said Quentin to himself, &lsquo;here&#8217;s a
rum go.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had learned that expression in a school
in Salisbury, a long time ago as it seemed.</p>

<p>The stone on which he lay dipped and rose
to a rhythm which he knew well enough. He
had felt it when he and his mother went in a
<a name="png.105" id="png.105"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">78</span><span class="ns">
 </span>little boat from Keyhaven to Alum Bay in the
Isle of Wight. There was no doubt in his
mind. He was on a ship. But how, but
why? Who could have carried him all that
way without waking him? Was it magic?
Accidental magic? The St. John&#8217;s wort
perhaps? And the stone&mdash;it was not the
same. It was new, clean cut, and, where
the wind displaced a corner of the curtain,
dazzlingly white in the sunlight.</p>

<p>There was the pat pat of bare feet on the
deck, a dull sort of shuffling as though people
were arranging themselves. And then people
outside the awning began to sing. It was a
strange song, not at all like any music you or I
have ever heard. It had no tune, no more tune
than a drum has, or a trumpet, but it had a
sort of wild rough glorious exciting splendour
about it, and gave you the sort of intense all-alive
feeling that drums and trumpets give.</p>

<p>Quentin lifted a corner of the purple curtain
and looked out.</p>

<p>Instantly the song stopped, drowned in the
deepest silence Quentin had ever imagined.
It was only broken by the flip-flapping of the
sheets against the masts of the ship. For it
was a ship, Quentin saw that as the bulwark
dipped to show him an unending waste of sea,
broken by bigger waves than he had ever
<a name="png.108" id="png.108"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">79</span><span class="ns">
 </span>dreamed of. He saw also a crowd of men,
dressed in white and blue and purple and gold.
Their right arms were raised towards the sun,
half of whose face showed across the sea&mdash;but
they seemed to be, as my old nurse used to
say, &lsquo;struck so,&rsquo; for their eyes were not fixed on
the sun, but on Quentin. And not in anger,
he noticed curiously, but with surprise and
&hellip; could it be that they were afraid of him?</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.107" id="png.107"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">opp p79</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-107.png"
 width="536" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Answer, I adjure you by the sacred Tau!&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Quentin was shivering with the surprise and
newness of it all. He had read about magic,
but he had not wholly believed in it, and yet,
now, if this was not magic, what was it? You
go to sleep on an old stone in a ruin. You
wake on the same stone, quite new, on a ship.
Magic, magic, if ever there was magic in this
wonderful, mysterious world!</p>

<p>The silence became awkward. Some one
had to say something.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good-morning,&rsquo; said Quentin, feeling that
he ought perhaps to be the one.</p>

<p>Instantly every one in sight fell on his face
on the deck.</p>

<p>Only one, a tall man with a black beard and
a blue mantle, stood up and looked Quentin in
the eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Answer, I
adjure you by the Sacred Tau!&rsquo; Now this
was very odd, and Quentin could never understand
<a name="png.109" id="png.109"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">80</span><span class="ns">
 </span>it, but when this man spoke Quentin
understood <em>him</em> perfectly, and yet at the same
time he knew that the man was speaking a
foreign language. So that his thought was
not, &lsquo;Hullo, you speak English!&rsquo; but &lsquo;Hullo,
I can understand your language.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am Quentin <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'De Ward'">de Ward</ins>,&rsquo; he said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A name from other stars! How came you
here?&rsquo; asked the blue-mantled man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>I</em> don&#8217;t know,&rsquo; said Quentin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He does not know. He did not sail with
us. It is by magic that he is here,&rsquo; said Blue
Mantle. &lsquo;Rise, all, and greet the Chosen of
the Gods.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They rose from the deck, and Quentin saw
that they were all bearded men, with bright,
earnest eyes, dressed in strange dress of something
like jersey and tunic and heavy golden
ornaments.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hail! Chosen of the Gods,&rsquo; cried Blue
Mantle, who seemed to be the leader.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hail, Chosen of the Gods!&rsquo; echoed the rest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you very much, I&#8217;m sure,&rsquo; said
Quentin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And what is this stone?&rsquo; asked Blue
Mantle, pointing to the stone on which Quentin
sat.</p>

<p>And Quentin, anxious to show off his
knowledge, said:</p>

<p><a name="png.110" id="png.110"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">81</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I&#8217;m not quite sure, but I <em>think</em> it&#8217;s the altar
stone of Stonehenge.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is proved,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle. &lsquo;Thou
art the Chosen of the Gods. Is there anything
my Lord needs?&rsquo; he added humbly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I &hellip; I&#8217;m rather hungry,&rsquo; said Quentin;
&lsquo;it&#8217;s a long time since dinner, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They brought him bread and bananas, and
oranges.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle, &lsquo;of the fruits of
the earth, and specially of this, which gives
drink and meat and ointment to man,&rsquo; suddenly
offering a large cocoa-nut.</p>

<p>Quentin took, with appropriate &lsquo;Thank
you&#8217;s&rsquo; and &lsquo;You&#8217;re very kind&#8217;s.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle, &lsquo;is too good
for the Chosen of the Gods. All that we have
is yours, to the very last day of your life you
have only to command, and we obey. You
will like to eat in seclusion. And afterwards
you will let us behold the whole person of the
Chosen of the Gods.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Quentin retired into the purple tent, with
the fruits and the cocoa-nut. As you know, a
cocoa-nut is not handy to get at the inside of,
at the best of times, so Quentin set that aside,
meaning to ask Blue Mantle later on for a
gimlet and a hammer.</p>

<p>When he had had enough to eat he peeped
<a name="png.111" id="png.111"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">82</span><span class="ns">
 </span>out again. Blue Mantle was on the watch and
came quickly forward.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said he, very crossly indeed, &lsquo;tell
me how you got here. This Chosen of the
Gods business is all very well for the vulgar.
But you and I know that there is no such
thing as magic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Speak for yourself,&rsquo; said Quentin. &lsquo;If I&#8217;m
not here by magic I&#8217;m not here at all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, you are,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know I am,&rsquo; said Quentin, &lsquo;but if I&#8217;m
not here by magic what am I here by?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stowawayishness,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you think that why don&#8217;t you treat me
as a stowaway?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because of public opinion,&rsquo; said Blue
Mantle, rubbing his nose in an angry sort of
perplexedness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well,&rsquo; said Quentin, who was feeling
so surprised and bewildered that it was a real
relief to him to bully somebody. &lsquo;Now look
here. I came here by magic, accidental
magic. I belong to quite a different world
from yours. But perhaps you are right about
my being the Chosen of the Gods. And I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t tell you anything about my world. But
I command you, by the Sacred Tau&rsquo; (he had
been quick enough to catch and remember
the word), &lsquo;to tell me who you are, and
<a name="png.112" id="png.112"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">83</span><span class="ns">
 </span>where you come from, and where you are
going.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Blue Mantle shrugged his shoulders. &lsquo;Oh,
well,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;if you invoke the sacred names
of Power&hellip;. But I don&#8217;t call it fair play.
Especially as you know perfectly well, and just
want to browbeat me into telling lies. I shall
not tell lies. I shall tell you the truth.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hoped you would,&rsquo; said Quentin gently.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle, &lsquo;I am a
Priest of Poseidon, and I come from the great
and immortal kingdom of Atlantis.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;From the temple where the gold statue is,
with the twelve sea-horses in gold?&rsquo; Quentin
asked eagerly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, I knew you knew all about it,&rsquo; said
Blue Mantle, &lsquo;so I don&#8217;t need to tell you that
I am taking the sacred stone, on which you
are sitting (profanely if you are a mere stowaway,
and not the Chosen of the Gods) to
complete the splendid structure of a temple
built on a great plain in the second of the
islands which are our colonies in the North
East.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me all about Atlantis,&rsquo; said Quentin.
And the priest, protesting that Quentin knew
as much about it as he did, told.</p>

<p>And all the time the ship was ploughing
through the waves, sometimes sailing, sometimes
<a name="png.113" id="png.113"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">84</span><span class="ns">
 </span>rowed by hidden rowers with long oars.
And Quentin was served in all things as though
he had been a king. If he had insisted that
he was not the Chosen of the Gods everything
might have been different. But he did not.
And he was very anxious to show how much
he knew about Atlantis. And sometimes he
was wrong, the Priest said, but much more
often he was right.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We are less than three days&#8217; journey now
from the Eastern Isles,&rsquo; Blue Mantle said one
day, &lsquo;and I warn you that if you are a mere
stowaway you had better own it. Because
if you persist in calling yourself the Chosen
of the Gods you will be expected to act as
such&mdash;to the very end.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t call myself anything,&rsquo; said Quentin,
&lsquo;though I am not a stowaway, anyhow, and
I don&#8217;t know how I came here&mdash;so of course
it was magic. It&#8217;s simply silly your being so
cross. <em>I</em> can&#8217;t help being here. Let&#8217;s be
friends.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle, much less crossly,
&lsquo;I never believed in magic, though I <em>am</em> a
priest, but if it is, it is. We may as well be
friends, as you call it. It isn&#8217;t for very long,
anyway,&rsquo; he added mysteriously.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.115" id="png.115"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">opp p85</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-115.png"
 width="650" height="649" alt="" title="" /><br
 />The cart was drawn by an enormous creature, more like an elephant than
anything else.</p>
</div>

<p>And then to show his friendliness he took
Quentin all over the ship, and explained it all to
<a name="png.116" id="png.116"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">85</span><span class="ns">
 </span>him. And Quentin enjoyed himself thoroughly,
though every now and then he had to pinch
himself to make sure that he was awake. And
he was fed well all the time, and all the time
made much of, so that when the ship reached
land he was quite sorry. The ship anchored
by a stone quay, most solid and serviceable,
and every one was very busy.</p>

<p>Quentin kept out of sight behind the purple
curtains. The sailors and the priests and the
priests&#8217; attendants and everybody on the boat
had asked him so many questions, and been
so curious about his clothes, that he was not
anxious to hear any more questions asked, or
to have to invent answers to them.</p>

<p>And after a very great deal of talk&mdash;almost
as much as Mr. Miles&#8217;s carrying had needed&mdash;the
altar stone was lifted, Quentin, curtains,
awning and all, and carried along a gangway
to the shore, and there it was put on a sort of
cart, more like what people in Manchester call
a lurry than anything else I can think of. The
wheels were made of solid circles of wood
bound round with copper. And the cart <!-- Transcriber's note: original has duplicate "was" -->
was drawn by&mdash;not horses or donkeys or oxen
or even dogs&mdash;but by an enormous creature
more like an elephant than anything else, only
it had long hair rather like the hair worn by
goats.</p>

<p><a name="png.117" id="png.117"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">86</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>You, perhaps, would not have known what
this vast creature was, but Quentin, who had
all sorts of out-of-the-way information packed
in his head, knew at once that it was a
mammoth.</p>

<p>And by that he knew, too, that he had
slipped back many thousands of years, because,
of course, it is a very long time indeed since
there were any mammoths alive, and able to
draw lurries. And the car and the priest and
the priest&#8217;s retinue and the stone and Quentin
and the mammoth journeyed slowly away from
the coast, passing through great green forests
and among strange gray mountains.</p>

<p>Where were they journeying?</p>

<p>Quentin asked the same question you may
be sure, and Blue Mantle told him&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;To Stonehenge.&rsquo; And Quentin understood
him perfectly, though Stonehenge was not the
word Blue Mantle used, or anything like it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The great temple is now complete,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;all but the altar stone. It will be the
most wonderful temple ever built in any of the
colonies of Atlantis. And it will be consecrated
on the longest day of the year.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Midsummer Day,&rsquo; said Quentin thoughtlessly&mdash;and,
as usual, anxious to tell all he
knew. &lsquo;I know. The sun strikes through
the arch on to the altar stone at sunrise.
<a name="png.118" id="png.118"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">87</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Hundreds of people go to see it: the ruins are
quite crowded sometimes, I believe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ruins?&rsquo; said the priest in a terrible voice.
&lsquo;Crowded? Ruins?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; said Quentin hastily, &lsquo;the sun
will still shine the same way even when the
temple is in ruins, won&#8217;t it?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The temple,&rsquo; said the priest, &lsquo;is built to
defy time. It will never be in ruins.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s all <em>you</em> know,&rsquo; said Quentin, not
very politely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is not by any means all I know,&rsquo; said
the priest. &lsquo;I do not tell all I know. Nor
do you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I used to,&rsquo; said Quentin, &lsquo;but I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t any
more. It only leads to trouble&mdash;I see that
now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now, though Quentin had been intensely
interested in everything he had seen in the
ship and on the journey, you may be sure he
had not lost sight of the need there was to get
back out of this time of Atlantis into his own
time. He knew that he must have got into
these Atlantean times by some very simple
accidental magic, and he felt no doubt that he
should get back in the same way. He felt
almost sure that the reverse-action, so to speak,
of the magic would begin when the stone got
back to the place where it had lain for so many
<a name="png.119" id="png.119"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">88</span><span class="ns">
 </span>thousand years before he happened to go to
sleep on it, and to start&mdash;perhaps by the St.
John&#8217;s wort&mdash;the accidental magic. If only,
when he got back there he could think of the
compelling, the magic word!</p>

<p>And now the slow procession wound over
the downs, and far away across the plain, which
was almost just the same then as it is now,
Quentin saw what he knew must be Stonehenge.
But it was no longer the grey pile of
ruins that you have perhaps seen&mdash;or have, at
any rate, seen pictures of.</p>

<p>From afar one could see the gleam of yellow
gold and red copper; the flutter of purple
curtains, the glitter and dazzle of shimmering
silver.</p>

<p>As they drew near to the spot Quentin
perceived that the great stones he remembered
were overlaid with ornamental work, with vivid,
bright-coloured paintings. The whole thing
was a great circular building, every stone in its
place. At a mile or two distant lay a town.
And in that town, with every possible luxury,
served with every circumstance of servile
homage, Quentin ate and slept.</p>

<p>I wish I had time to tell you what that town
was like where he slept and ate, but I have
not. You can read for yourself, some day,
what Atlantis was like. Plato tells us a good
<a name="png.120" id="png.120"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">89</span><span class="ns">
 </span>deal, and the Colonies of Atlantis must have
had at least a reasonable second-rate copy of
the cities of that fair and lovely land.</p>

<p>That night, for the first time since he had
first gone to sleep on the altar stone, Quentin
slept apart from it. He lay on a wooden
couch strewn with soft bear-skins, and a
woollen coverlet was laid over him. And he
slept soundly.</p>

<p>In the middle of the night, as it seemed,
Blue Mantle woke him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;Chosen of the Gods&mdash;since
you <em>will</em> be that, and no stowaway&mdash;the
hour draws nigh.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The mammoth was waiting. Quentin and
Blue Mantle rode on its back to the outer
porch of the new temple of Stonehenge.
Rows of priests and attendants, robed in white
and blue and purple, formed a sort of avenue
up which Blue Mantle led the Chosen of the
Gods, who was Quentin. They took off his
jacket and put a white dress on him, rather like
a night-shirt without sleeves. And they put a
thick wreath of London Pride on his head and
another, larger and longer, round his neck.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If only the chaps at school could see me
now!&rsquo; he said to himself proudly.</p>

<p>And by this time it was gray dawn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lie down now,&rsquo; said Blue Mantle, &lsquo;lie
<a name="png.121" id="png.121"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">90</span><span class="ns">
 </span>down, O Beloved of the Gods, upon the altar
stone, for the last time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall be able to go, then?&rsquo; Quentin
asked. This accidental magic was, he perceived,
a tricky thing, and he wanted to be sure.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will not be able to stay,&rsquo; said the
priest. &lsquo;If going is what you desire, the
desire of the Chosen of the Gods is fully
granted.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The grass on the plain far and near rustled
with the tread of many feet; the cold air of
dawn thrilled to the awed murmured of many
voices.</p>

<p>Quentin lay down, with his pink wreaths
and his white robe, and watched the quickening
pinkiness of the East. And slowly the great
circle of the temple filled with white-robed folk,
all carrying in their hands the faint pinkiness of
the flowers which we nowadays call London
Pride.</p>

<p>And all eyes were fixed on the arch through
which, at sunrise on Midsummer Day, the sun&#8217;s
first beam should fall upon the white, new, clean
altar stone. The stone is still there, after all
these thousands of years, and at sunrise on
Midsummer Day the sun&#8217;s first ray still falls
on it.</p>

<div class="illus">

 width="504" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />&lsquo;Silence,&rsquo; cried the priest. &lsquo;Chosen of the Immortals, close your eyes!&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The sky grew lighter and lighter, and at
last the sun peered redly over the down, and
<a name="png.124" id="png.124"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">91</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the first ray of the morning sunlight fell full on
the altar stone and on the face of Quentin.</p>

<p>And, as it did so, a very tall, white-robed
priest with a deer-skin apron and a curious
winged head-dress stepped forward. He
carried a great bronze knife, and he waved it
ten times in the shaft of sunlight that shot
through the arch and on to the altar stone.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thus,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;thus do I bathe the
sacred blade in the pure fountain of all light,
all wisdom, all splendour. In the name of the
ten kings, the ten virtues, the ten hopes, the
ten fears I make my weapon clean! May this
temple of our love and our desire endure for
ever, so long as the glory of our Lord the Sun
is shed upon this earth. May the sacrifice I
now humbly and proudly offer be acceptable to
the gods by whom it has been so miraculously
provided. Chosen of the Gods! return to the
gods who sent thee!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A roar of voices rang through the temple.
The bronze knife was raised over Quentin.
He could not believe that this, this horror, was
the end of all these wonderful happenings.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No&mdash;no,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;it&#8217;s not true. I&#8217;m
not the Chosen of the Gods! I&#8217;m only a little
boy that&#8217;s got here by accidental magic!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Silence,&rsquo; cried the priest, &lsquo;Chosen of the
Immortals, close your eyes! It will not hurt.
<a name="png.125" id="png.125"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">92</span><span class="ns">
 </span>This life is only a dream; the other life is the
real life. Be strong, be brave!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Quentin was not brave. But he shut his
eyes. He could not help it. The glitter of
the bronze knife in the sunlight was too strong
for him.</p>

<p>He could not believe that this could really
have happened to him. Every one had been so
kind&mdash;so friendly to him. And it was all for this!</p>

<p>Suddenly a sharp touch at his side told him
that for this, indeed, it had all been. He felt
the point of the knife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; he cried. And opened his eyes
again.</p>

<p>He always felt quite sure afterwards that
&lsquo;Mother&rsquo; was the master-word, the spell of
spells. For when he opened his eyes there
was no priest, no white-robed worshippers, no
splendour of colour and metal, no Chosen of
the Gods, no knife&mdash;only a little boy with a
piece of sacking over him, damp with the night
dews, lying on a stone amid the grey ruins of
Stonehenge, and, all about him, a crowd of
tourists who had come to see the sun&#8217;s first
shaft strike the age-old altar of Stonehenge on
Midsummer Day in the morning. And instead
of a knife point at his side there was only the
ferrule of the umbrella of an elderly and retired
tea merchant in a mackintosh and an Alpine
<a name="png.126" id="png.126"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">93</span><span class="ns">
 </span>hat,&mdash;a ferrule which had prodded the sleeping
boy so unexpectedly surprised on the very
altar stone where the sun&#8217;s ray now lingered.</p>

<p>And then, in a moment, he knew that he
had not uttered the spell in vain, the word of
compelling, the word of power: for his mother
was there kneeling beside him. I am sorry to
say that he cried as he clung to her. <em>We</em>
cannot all of us be brave, always.</p>

<p>The tourists were very kind and interested,
and the tea merchant insisted on giving Quentin
something out of a flask, which was so nasty
that Quentin only pretended to drink, out of
politeness. His mother had a carriage waiting,
and they escaped to it while the tourists were
saying, &lsquo;How romantic!&rsquo; and asking each
other whatever in the world had happened.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>&lsquo;But how <em>did</em> you come to be there,
darling?&rsquo; said his mother with warm hands
comfortingly round him. &lsquo;I&#8217;ve been looking
for you all night. I went to say good-bye to
you yesterday&mdash;Oh, Quentin&mdash;and I found
you&#8217;d run away. How <em>could</em> you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sorry,&rsquo; said Quentin, &lsquo;if it worried you,
I&#8217;m sorry. Very, very. I was going to
telegraph to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But where have you been? What have you
been doing all night?&rsquo; she asked, caressing him.</p>

<p><a name="png.127" id="png.127"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">94</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Is it only one night?&rsquo; said Quentin. &lsquo;I
don&#8217;t know exactly what&#8217;s happened. It was
accidental magic, I think, mother. I&#8217;m glad
I thought of the right word to get back,
though.&rsquo; And then he told her all about it.
She held him very tightly and let him talk.</p>

<p>Perhaps she thought that a little boy to
whom accidental magic happened all in a minute,
like that, was not exactly the right little boy
for that excellent school in Salisbury. Anyhow
she took him to Egypt with her to meet his
father, and, on the way, they happened to see
a doctor in London who said: &lsquo;Nerves&rsquo; which
is a poor name for accidental magic, and
Quentin does not believe it means the same
thing at all.</p>

<p>Quentin&#8217;s father is well now, and he has
left the army, and father and mother and
Quentin live in a jolly, little, old house in
Salisbury, and Quentin is a &lsquo;day boy&rsquo; at that
very same school. He and Smithson minor
are the greatest of friends. But he has never
told Smithson minor about the accidental
magic. He has learned now, and learned very
thoroughly, that it is not always wise to tell
all you know. If he had not owned that he
knew that it was the Stonehenge altar
stone!</p>

 />THE PRINCESS AND THE
 <span class="nw">HEDGE-PIG</span></h2>


<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">But</span> I don&#8217;t see what we&#8217;re to <em>do</em>&rsquo; said the
Queen for the twentieth time.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Whatever we do will end in misfortune,&rsquo;
said the King gloomily; &lsquo;you&#8217;ll see it <!-- opening quote missing in original -->
will.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They were sitting in the honeysuckle arbour
talking things over, while the nurse walked
up and down the terrace with the new baby
in her arms.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear,&rsquo; said the poor Queen; &lsquo;I&#8217;ve
not the slightest doubt I shall.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Misfortune comes in many ways, and you
can&#8217;t always know beforehand that a certain
way is the way misfortune will come by: but
there are things misfortune comes after as
surely as night comes after day. For instance,
if you let all the water boil away, the kettle
will have a hole burnt in it. If you leave the
bath taps running and the waste-pipe closed,
<a name="png.130" id="png.130"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">97</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the stairs of your house will, sooner or later,
resemble Niagara. If you leave your purse
at home, you won&#8217;t have it with you when you
want to pay your tram-fare. And if you throw
lighted wax matches at your muslin curtains,
your parent will most likely have to pay five
pounds to the fire engines for coming round
and blowing the fire out with a wet hose.
Also if you are a king and do not invite the
wicked fairy to your christening parties, she
will come all the same. And if you do ask
the wicked fairy, she will come, and in either
case it will be the worse for the new princess.
So what is a poor monarch to do? Of course
there is one way out of the difficulty, and
that is not to have a christening party at
all. But this offends all the good fairies, and
then where are you?</p>

<p>All these reflections had presented themselves
to the minds of King Ozymandias and
his Queen, and neither of them could deny
that they were in a most awkward situation.
They were &lsquo;talking it over&rsquo; for the hundredth
time on the palace terrace where the pomegranates
and oleanders grew in green tubs and
the marble balustrade is overgrown with roses,
red and white and pink and yellow. On the
lower terrace the royal nurse was walking
up and down with the baby princess that all
<a name="png.131" id="png.131"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">98</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the fuss was about. The Queen&#8217;s eyes followed
the baby admiringly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The darling!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Oh, Ozymandias,
don&#8217;t you sometimes wish we&#8217;d been poor
people?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never!&rsquo; said the King decidedly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I do,&rsquo; said the Queen; &lsquo;then we could
have had just you and me and your sister at
the christening, and no fear of&mdash;oh! I&#8217;ve
thought of something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King&#8217;s patient expression showed that
he did not think it likely that she would have
thought of anything useful; but at the first five
words his expression changed. You would
have said that he pricked up his ears, if kings
had ears that could be pricked up. What she
said was&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let&#8217;s have a secret christening.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How?&rsquo; asked the King.</p>

<p>The Queen was gazing in the direction of
the baby with what is called a &lsquo;far away look&rsquo;
in her eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a minute,&rsquo; she said slowly. &lsquo;I see it
all&mdash;yes&mdash;we&#8217;ll have the party in the cellars&mdash;you
know they&#8217;re splendid.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My great-grandfather had them built by
Lancashire men, yes,&rsquo; interrupted the King.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.132" id="png.132"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 />On the lower terrace the royal nurse was walking up and down with the
baby princess that all the fuss was about.</p>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;We&#8217;ll send out the invitations to look like
bills. The baker&#8217;s boy can take them. He&#8217;s
<a name="png.134" id="png.134"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">99</span><span class="ns">
 </span>a very nice boy. He made baby laugh
yesterday when I was explaining to him about
the Standard Bread. We&#8217;ll just put &ldquo;1 loaf 3.
A remittance at your earliest convenience will
oblige.&rdquo; That&#8217;ll mean that 1 person is invited
for 3 o&#8217;clock, and on the back we&#8217;ll write where
and why in invisible ink. Lemon juice, you
know. And the baker&#8217;s boy shall be told to
ask to see the people&mdash;just as they do when they
<em>really</em> mean earliest convenience&mdash;and then he
shall just whisper: &ldquo;Deadly secret. Lemon
juice. Hold it to the fire,&rdquo; and come away.
Oh, dearest, do say you approve!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King laid down his pipe, set his crown
straight, and kissed the Queen with great and
serious earnestness.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You are a wonder,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;It is the very
thing. But the baker&#8217;s boy is very small.
Can we trust him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He is nine,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;and I have
sometimes thought that he must be a prince
in disguise. He is so very intelligent.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Queen&#8217;s plan was carried out. The
cellars, which were really extraordinarily fine,
were secretly decorated by the King&#8217;s confidential
man and the Queen&#8217;s confidential
maid and a few of <em>their</em> confidential friends
whom they knew they could really trust.
You would never have thought they were
<a name="png.135" id="png.135"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">100</span><span class="ns">
 </span>cellars when the decorations were finished.
The walls were hung with white satin and
white velvet, with wreaths of white roses, and
the stone floors were covered with freshly cut
turf with white daisies, brisk and neat, growing
in it.</p>

<p>The invitations were duly delivered by the
baker&#8217;s boy. On them was written in plain
blue ink,</p><!-- Transcriber's note: original has period in place of comma -->

<p class="ctr">&lsquo;<span class="smcap">The Royal Bakeries</span><br
 />1 loaf 3d.<br
 />An early remittance will oblige.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And when the people held the letter to the
fire, as they were whisperingly instructed to
do by the baker&#8217;s boy, they read in a faint
brown writing:&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;King Ozymandias and Queen Eliza invite
you to the christening of their daughter Princess
Ozyliza at three on Wednesday in the Palace
cellars.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;We are obliged to be very secret
and careful because of wicked fairies, so please
come disguised as a tradesman with a bill,
calling for the last time before it leaves your
hands.&rsquo;</p>

<p>You will understand by this that the King
and Queen were not as well off as they could
wish; so that tradesmen calling at the palace
with that sort of message was the last thing
<a name="png.136" id="png.136"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">101</span><span class="ns">
 </span>likely to excite remark. But as most of the
King&#8217;s subjects were not very well off either,
this was merely a bond between the King and
his people. They could sympathise with each
other, and understand each other&#8217;s troubles in
a way impossible to most kings and most
nations.</p>

<p>You can imagine the excitement in the
families of the people who were invited to the
christening party, and the interest they felt in
their costumes. The Lord Chief Justice disguised
himself as a shoemaker; he still had
his old blue brief-bag by him, and a brief-bag
and a boot-bag are very much alike. The
Commander-in-Chief dressed as a dog&#8217;s meat
man and wheeled a barrow. The Prime
Minister appeared as a tailor; this required no
change of dress and only a slight change of expression.
And the other courtiers all disguised
themselves perfectly. So did the good fairies,
who had, of course, been invited first of all.
Benevola, Queen of the Good Fairies, disguised
herself as a moonbeam, which can go into any
palace and no questions asked. Serena, the
next in command, dressed as a butterfly, and
all the other fairies had disguises equally pretty
and tasteful.</p>

<p>The Queen looked most kind and beautiful,
the King very handsome and manly, and all
<a name="png.137" id="png.137"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">102</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the guests agreed that the new princess was
the most beautiful baby they had ever seen in
all their born days.</p>

<p>Everybody brought the most charming
christening presents concealed beneath their
disguises. The fairies gave the usual gifts,
beauty, grace, intelligence, charm, and so on.</p>

<p>Everything seemed to be going better than
well. But of course you know it wasn&#8217;t. The
Lord High Admiral had not been able to get a
cook&#8217;s dress large enough completely to cover
his uniform; a bit of an epaulette had peeped
out, and the wicked fairy, Malevola, had spotted
it as he went past her to the palace back door,
near which she had been sitting disguised as a
dog without a collar hiding from the police, and
enjoying what she took to be the trouble the
royal household were having with their tradesmen.</p>

<p>Malevola almost jumped out of her dog-skin
when she saw the glitter of that epaulette.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hullo?&rsquo; she said, and sniffed quite like a
dog. &lsquo;I must look into this,&rsquo; said she, and
disguising herself as a toad, she crept unseen
into the pipe by which the copper emptied itself
into the palace moat&mdash;for of course there
was a copper in one of the palace cellars as
there always is in cellars in the North Country.</p>

<p>Now this copper had been a great trial to
<a name="png.138" id="png.138"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">103</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the decorators. If there is anything you don&#8217;t
like about your house, you can either try to
conceal it or &lsquo;make a feature of it.&rsquo; And as
concealment of the copper was impossible, it
was decided to &lsquo;make it a feature&rsquo; by covering
it with green moss and planting a tree in it, a
little apple tree all in bloom. It had been very
much admired.</p>

<p>Malevola, hastily altering her disguise to
that of a mole, dug her way through the earth
that the copper was full of, got to the top and
put out a sharp nose just as Benevola was
saying in that soft voice which Malevola always
thought so affected,&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The Princess shall love and be loved all
her life long.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So she shall,&rsquo; said the wicked fairy, assuming
her own shape amid the screams of the
audience. &lsquo;Be quiet, you silly cuckoo,&rsquo; she said
to the Lord Chamberlain, whose screams were
specially piercing, &lsquo;or I&#8217;ll give <em>you</em> a christening
present too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Instantly there was a dreadful silence. Only
Queen Eliza, who had caught up the baby
at Malevola&#8217;s first word, said feebly,&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, <em>don&#8217;t</em>, dear Malevola.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the King said, &lsquo;It isn&#8217;t exactly a party,
don&#8217;t you know. Quite informal. Just a few
friends dropped in, eh, what?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.139" id="png.139"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">104</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;So I perceive,&rsquo; said Malevola, laughing
that dreadful laugh of hers which makes other
people feel as though they would never be able
to laugh any more. &lsquo;Well, I&#8217;ve <!-- apostrophe invisible in original -->
dropped in too.
Let&#8217;s have a look at the child.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The poor Queen dared not refuse. She
tottered forward with the baby in her arms.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Malevola, &lsquo;your precious
daughter will have beauty and grace and all the
rest of the tuppenny halfpenny rubbish those
niminy-piminy minxes have given her. But
she will be turned out of her kingdom. She
will have to face her enemies without a single
human being to stand by her, and she shall
never come to her own again until she <span class="nw">finds&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span>
Malevola hesitated. She could not think of
anything sufficiently unlikely&mdash;&lsquo;until she finds,&rsquo;
she <span class="nw">repeated&mdash;&mdash;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;A thousand spears to follow her to battle,&rsquo;
said a new voice, &lsquo;a thousand spears devoted
to her and to her alone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>A very young fairy fluttered down from the
little apple tree where she had been hiding
among the pink and white blossom.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am very young, I know,&rsquo; she said
apologetically, &lsquo;and I&#8217;ve only just finished my
last course of Fairy History. So I know that
if a fairy stops more than half a second in a
curse she can&#8217;t go on, and some one else may
<a name="png.140" id="png.140"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">105</span><span class="ns">
 </span>finish it for her. That is so, Your Majesty,
isn&#8217;t it?&rsquo; she said, appealing to Benevola.
And the Queen of the Fairies said Yes, that
was the law, only it was such an old one most
people had forgotten it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You think yourself very clever,&rsquo; said
Malevola, &lsquo;but as a matter of fact you&#8217;re simply
silly. That&#8217;s the very thing I&#8217;ve provided
against. She <em>can&#8217;t</em> have any one to stand by
her in battle, so she&#8217;ll lose her kingdom and
every one will be killed, and I shall come to the
funeral. It will be enormous,&rsquo; she added rubbing
her hands at the joyous thought.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you&#8217;ve quite finished,&rsquo; said the King
politely, &lsquo;and if you&#8217;re sure you won&#8217;t take
any refreshment, may I wish you a very good
afternoon?&rsquo; He held the door open himself,
and Malevola went out chuckling. The whole
of the party then burst into tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; said the King at last, wiping
his eyes with the tails of his ermine. &lsquo;It&#8217;s a
long way off and perhaps it won&#8217;t happen after all.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>But of course it did.</p>

<p>The King did what he could to prepare his
daughter for the fight in which she was to
stand alone against her enemies. He had her
taught fencing and riding and shooting, both
with the cross bow and the long bow, as well
<a name="png.141" id="png.141"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">106</span><span class="ns">
 </span>as with pistols, rifles, and artillery. She learned
to dive and to swim, to run and to jump, to box
and to wrestle, so that she grew up as strong
and healthy as any young man, and could, indeed,
have got the best of a fight with any prince of
her own age. But the few princes who called
at the palace did not come to fight the Princess,
and when they heard that the Princess had no
dowry except the gifts of the fairies, and also
what Malevola&#8217;s gift had been, they all said
they had just looked in as they were passing
and that they must be going now, thank you.
And went.</p>

<p>And then the dreadful thing happened.
The tradesmen, who had for years been calling
for the last time before, etc., really decided to
place the matter in other hands. They called
in a neighbouring king who marched his army
into Ozymandias&#8217;s country, conquered the army&mdash;the
soldiers&#8217; wages hadn&#8217;t been paid for years&mdash;turned
out the King and Queen, paid the
tradesmen&#8217;s bills, had most of the palace walls
papered with the receipts, and set up housekeeping
there himself.</p>

<p>Now when this happened the Princess was
away on a visit to her aunt, the Empress of
Oricalchia, half the world away, and there is
no regular post between the two countries, so
that when she came home, travelling with a
<a name="png.142" id="png.142"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">107</span><span class="ns">
 </span>train of fifty-four camels, which is rather slow
work, and arrived at her own kingdom, she
expected to find all the flags flying and the
bells ringing and the streets decked in roses
to welcome her home.</p>

<p>Instead of which nothing of the kind. The
streets were all as dull as dull, the shops were
closed because it was early-closing day, and
she did not see a single person she knew.</p>

<p>She left the fifty-four camels laden with the
presents her aunt had given her outside the
gates, and rode alone on her own pet camel
to the palace, wondering whether perhaps her
father had not received the letter she had sent
on ahead by carrier pigeon the day before.</p>

<p>And when she got to the palace and got off
her camel and went in, there was a strange
king on her father&#8217;s throne and a strange
queen sat in her mother&#8217;s place at his side.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Where&#8217;s my father?&rsquo; said the Princess,
bold as brass, standing on the steps of the
throne. &lsquo;And what are you doing there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I might ask you that,&rsquo; said the King.
&lsquo;Who are you, anyway?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am the Princess Ozyliza,&rsquo; said she.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve heard of you,&rsquo; said the King.
&lsquo;You&#8217;ve been expected for some time. Your
father&#8217;s been evicted, so now you know. No,
I can&#8217;t give you his address.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.143" id="png.143"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">108</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Just then some one came and whispered to
the Queen that fifty-four camels laden with
silks and velvets and monkeys and parakeets
and the richest treasures of Oricalchia were
outside the city gate. She put two and two
together, and whispered to the King, who
nodded and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish to make a new law.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Every one fell flat on his face. The law is
so much respected in that country.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No one called Ozyliza is allowed to own
property in this kingdom,&rsquo; said the King.
&lsquo;Turn out that stranger.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Princess was turned out of her
father&#8217;s palace, and went out and cried in the
palace gardens where she had been so happy
when she was little.</p>

<p>And the baker&#8217;s boy, who was now the
baker&#8217;s young man, came by with the standard
bread and saw some one crying among the
oleanders, and went to say, &lsquo;Cheer up!&rsquo; to
whoever it was. And it was the Princess.
He knew her at once.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Princess,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;cheer up! Nothing
is ever so bad as it seems.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Baker&#8217;s Boy,&rsquo; said she, for she knew
him too, &lsquo;how can I cheer up? I am turned
out of my kingdom. I haven&#8217;t got my father&#8217;s
address, and I have to face my enemies
<a name="png.146" id="png.146"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">109</span><span class="ns">
 </span>without a single human being to stand by
me.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.145" id="png.145"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">opp p109</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img src="images/illus-145.png"
 width="503" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />Instantly a flight of winged arrows crossed the garden.</p>
</div>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s not true, at any rate,&rsquo; said the
baker&#8217;s boy, whose name was Erinaceus,
&lsquo;you&#8217;ve got me. If you&#8217;ll let me be your
squire, I&#8217;ll follow you round the world and help
you to fight your enemies.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You won&#8217;t be let,&rsquo; said the Princess sadly,
&lsquo;but I thank you very much all the same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She dried her eyes and stood up.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I must go,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;and I&#8217;ve nowhere
to go to.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Now as soon as the Princess had been
turned out of the palace, the Queen said,
&lsquo;You&#8217;d much better have beheaded her for
treason.&rsquo; And the King said, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll tell the
archers to pick her off as she leaves the
grounds.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So when she stood up, out there among the
oleanders, some one on the terrace cried,
&lsquo;There she is!&rsquo; and instantly a flight of winged
arrows crossed the garden. At the cry
Erinaceus flung himself in front of her, clasping
her in his arms and turning his back to the
arrows. The Royal Archers were a thousand
strong and all excellent shots. Erinaceus
felt a thousand arrows sticking into his back.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And now my last friend is dead,&rsquo; cried the
Princess. But being a very strong princess,
<a name="png.147" id="png.147"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">110</span><span class="ns">
 </span>she dragged him into the shrubbery out of
sight of the palace, and then dragged him into
the wood and called aloud on Benevola, Queen
of the Fairies, and Benevola came.</p>

<p>&lsquo;They&#8217;ve killed my only friend,&rsquo; said the
Princess, &lsquo;at least&hellip;. Shall I pull out the
arrows?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you do,&rsquo; said the Fairy, &lsquo;he&#8217;ll certainly
bleed to death.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And he&#8217;ll die if they stay in,&rsquo; said the
Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not necessarily,&rsquo; said the Fairy; &lsquo;let me
cut them a little shorter.&rsquo; She did, with her
fairy pocket-knife. &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll do
what I can, but I&#8217;m afraid it&#8217;ll be a disappointment
to you both. Erinaceus,&rsquo; she went on,
addressing the unconscious baker&#8217;s boy with
the stumps of the arrows still sticking in him,
&lsquo;I command you, as soon as I have vanished,
to assume the form of a hedge-pig. The hedge-pig,&rsquo;
she exclaimed to the Princess, &lsquo;is the only
nice person who can live comfortably with a
thousand spikes sticking out of him. Yes, I
know there are porcupines, but porcupines are
vicious and ill-mannered. Good-bye!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with that she vanished. So did Erinaceus,
and the Princess found herself alone
among the oleanders; and on the green turf
was a small and very prickly brown hedge-pig.</p>

<p><a name="png.148" id="png.148"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">111</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh, dear!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;now I&#8217;m all alone
again, and the baker&#8217;s boy has given his life
for mine, and mine isn&#8217;t worth having.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s worth more than all the world,&rsquo; said a
sharp little voice at her feet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, can you talk?&rsquo; she said, quite cheered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; said the hedge-pig sturdily;
&lsquo;it&#8217;s only the <em>form</em> of the hedge-pig I&#8217;ve
assumed. I&#8217;m Erinaceus inside, all right
enough. Pick me up in a corner of your
mantle so as not to prick your darling hands.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You mustn&#8217;t call names, you know,&rsquo; said
the Princess, &lsquo;even your hedge-pigginess can&#8217;t
excuse such liberties.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sorry, Princess,&rsquo; said the hedge-pig,
&lsquo;but I can&#8217;t help it. Only human beings speak
lies; all other creatures tell the truth. Now
I&#8217;ve got a hedge-pig&#8217;s tongue it won&#8217;t speak
anything but the truth. And the truth is that
I love you more than all the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Princess thoughtfully, &lsquo;since
you&#8217;re a hedge-pig I suppose you may love me,
and I may love you. Like pet dogs or gold-fish.
Dear little hedge-pig, then!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t!&rsquo; said the hedge-pig, &lsquo;remember
I&#8217;m the baker&#8217;s boy in my mind and soul.
My hedge-pigginess is only skin-deep. Pick
me up, dearest of Princesses, and let us go to
seek our fortunes.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.149" id="png.149"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">112</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I think it&#8217;s my parents I ought to seek,&rsquo;
said the Princess. &lsquo;However&hellip;&rsquo;</p>

<p>She picked up the hedge-pig in the corner
of her mantle and they went away through the
wood.</p>

<p>They slept that night at a wood-cutter&#8217;s
cottage. The wood-cutter was very kind, and
made a nice little box of beech-wood for the
hedge-pig to be carried in, and he told the
Princess that most of her father&#8217;s subjects were
still loyal, but that no one could fight for him
because they would be fighting for the Princess
too, and however much they might wish to do
this, Malevola&#8217;s curse assured them that it was
impossible.</p>

<p>So the Princess put her hedge-pig in its
little box and went on, looking everywhere
for her father and mother, and, after more
adventures than I have time to tell you, she
found them at last, living in quite a poor way
in a semi-detached villa at Tooting. They
were very glad to see her, but when they heard
that she meant to try to get back the kingdom,
the King said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shouldn&#8217;t bother, my child, I really
shouldn&#8217;t. We are quite happy here. I have
the pension always given to Deposed Monarchs,
and your mother is becoming a really economical
manager.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.150" id="png.150"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">113</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The Queen blushed with pleasure, and said,
&lsquo;Thank you, dear. But if you should succeed
in turning that wicked usurper out, Ozyliza, I
hope I shall be a better queen than I used to
be. I am learning housekeeping at an evening
class at the Crown-maker&#8217;s Institute.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess kissed her parents and went
out into the garden to think it over. But the
garden was small and quite full of wet washing
hung on lines. So she went into the road,
but that was full of dust and perambulators.
Even the wet washing was better than that, so
she went back and sat down on the grass in a
white alley of tablecloths and sheets, all marked
with a crown in indelible ink. And she took
the hedge-pig out of the box. It was rolled up
in a ball, but she stroked the little bit of soft
forehead that you can always find if you look
carefully at a rolled-up hedge-pig, and the
hedge-pig uncurled and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am afraid I was asleep, Princess dear.
Did you want me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re the only person who knows all about
everything,&rsquo; said she. &lsquo;I haven&#8217;t told father
and mother about the arrows. Now what do
you advise?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Erinaceus was flattered at having his advice
asked, but unfortunately he hadn&#8217;t any to give.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s your work, Princess,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I can
<a name="png.151" id="png.151"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">114</span><span class="ns">
 </span>only promise to do anything a hedge-pig <em>can</em>
do. It&#8217;s not much. Of course I could die for
you, but that&#8217;s so useless.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said she.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish I were invisible,&rsquo; he said dreamily.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, where are you?&rsquo; cried Ozyliza, for the
hedge-pig had vanished.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said a sharp little voice. &lsquo;You can&#8217;t
see me, but I can see everything I want to see.
And I can see what to do. I&#8217;ll crawl into my
box, and you must disguise yourself as an old
French governess with the best references and
answer the advertisement that the wicked king
put yesterday in the &ldquo;Usurpers Journal.&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Queen helped the Princess to disguise
herself, which, of course, the Queen would never
have done if she had known about the arrows;
and the King gave her some of his pension to
buy a ticket with, so she went back quite
quickly, by train, to her own kingdom.</p>

<p>The usurping King at once engaged the
French governess to teach his cook to read
French cookery books, because the best recipes
are in French. Of course he had no idea that
there was a princess, <em>the</em> Princess, beneath the
governessial disguise. The French lessons
were from 6 to 8 in the morning and from 2 to
4 in the afternoon, and all the rest of the time
the governess could spend as she liked. She
<a name="png.152" id="png.152"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">115</span><span class="ns">
 </span>spent it walking about the palace gardens and
talking to her invisible hedge-pig. They talked
about everything under the sun, and the hedge-pig
was the best of company.</p>

<p>&lsquo;How did you become invisible?&rsquo; she asked
one day, and it said, &lsquo;I suppose it was Benevola&#8217;s
doing. Only I think every one gets <em>one</em>
wish granted if they only wish hard enough.&rsquo;</p>

<p>On the fifty-fifth day the hedge-pig said,
&lsquo;Now, Princess dear, I&#8217;m going to begin to get
you back your kingdom.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And next morning the King came down to
breakfast in a dreadful rage with his face
covered up in bandages.</p>

<p>&lsquo;This palace is haunted,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;In the
middle of the night a dreadful spiked ball was
thrown in my face. I lighted a match. There
was nothing.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Queen said, &lsquo;Nonsense! You must
have been dreaming.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But next morning it was her turn to come
down with a bandaged face. And the night
after, the King had the spiky ball thrown at him
again. And then the Queen had it. And then
they both had it, so that they couldn&#8217;t sleep at
all, and had to lie awake with nothing to
think of but their wickedness. And every five
minutes a very little voice whispered:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who stole the kingdom? Who killed the
<a name="png.153" id="png.153"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">116</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Princess?&rsquo; till the King and Queen could have
screamed with misery.</p>

<p>And at last the Queen said, &lsquo;We needn&#8217;t
have killed the Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the King said, &lsquo;I&#8217;ve been thinking
that, too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And next day the King said, &lsquo;I don&#8217;t know
that we ought to have taken this kingdom.
We had a really high-class kingdom of our
own.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ve been thinking that too,&rsquo; said the Queen.</p>

<p>By this time their hands and arms and necks
and faces and ears were very sore indeed, and
they were sick with want of sleep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look here,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;let&#8217;s chuck it.
Let&#8217;s write to Ozymandias and tell him he can
take over his kingdom again. I&#8217;ve had jolly
well enough of this.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let&#8217;s,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;but we can&#8217;t bring
the Princess to life again. I do wish we could,&rsquo;
and she cried a little through her bandages into
her egg, for it was breakfast time.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that,&rsquo; said a little sharp voice,
though there was no one to be seen in the room.
The King and Queen clung to each other in
terror, upsetting the urn over the toast-rack.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean it?&rsquo; said the voice again;
&lsquo;answer, yes or no.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;I don&#8217;t know who
<a name="png.154" id="png.154"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">117</span><span class="ns">
 </span>you are, but, yes, yes, yes. I can&#8217;t <em>think</em> how
we could have been so wicked.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then send for the French governess,&rsquo; said
the voice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ring the bell, dear,&rsquo; said the Queen. &lsquo;I&#8217;m
sure what it says is right. It is the voice of
conscience. I&#8217;ve often heard <em>of</em> it, but I never
heard it before.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King pulled the richly-jewelled bell-rope
and ten magnificent green and gold footmen
appeared.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Please ask Mademoiselle to step this way,&rsquo;
said the Queen.</p>

<p>The ten magnificent green and gold footmen
found the governess beside the marble basin
feeding the gold-fish, and, bowing their ten
green backs, they gave the Queen&#8217;s message.
The governess who, every one agreed, was
always most obliging, went at once to the pink
satin breakfast-room where the King and Queen
were sitting, almost unrecognisable in their
bandages.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, Your Majesties?&rsquo; said she curtseying.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The voice of conscience,&rsquo; said the Queen,
&lsquo;told us to send for you. Is there any recipe
in the French books for bringing shot princesses
to life? If so, will you kindly translate it
for us?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.155" id="png.155"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">118</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;There is <em>one</em>,&rsquo; said the Princess thoughtfully,
&lsquo;and it is quite simple. Take a king and a
queen and the voice of conscience. Place
them in a clean pink breakfast-room with eggs,
coffee, and toast. Add a full-sized French
governess. The king and queen must be
thoroughly pricked and bandaged, and the voice
of conscience must be very distinct.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is that all?&rsquo; asked the Queen.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s all,&rsquo; said the governess, &lsquo;except that
the king and queen must have two more
bandages over their eyes, and keep them on
till the voice of conscience has counted fifty-five
very slowly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you would be so kind,&rsquo; said the Queen, <!-- Transcriber's note: original lacks opening quote -->
&lsquo;as to bandage us with our table napkins? Only
be careful how you fold them, because our faces
are very sore, and the royal monogram is very
stiff and hard owing to its being embroidered
in seed pearls by special command.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will be very careful,&rsquo; said the governess
kindly.</p>

<p>The moment the King and Queen were
blindfolded, the &lsquo;voice of conscience&rsquo; began, &lsquo;one,
two, three,&rsquo; and Ozyliza tore off her disguise,
and under the fussy black-and-violet-spotted
alpaca of the French governess was the simple
slim cloth-of-silver dress of the Princess. She
stuffed the alpaca up the chimney and the grey
<a name="png.156" id="png.156"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">119</span><span class="ns">
 </span>wig into the tea-cosy, and had disposed of the
mittens in the coffee-pot and the elastic-side
boots in the coal-scuttle, just as the voice of
conscience said&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fifty-three, fifty-four, fifty-five!&rsquo; and stopped.</p>

<p>The King and Queen pulled off the bandages,
and there, alive and well, with bright clear eyes
and pinky cheeks and a mouth that smiled, was
the Princess whom they supposed to have been
killed by the thousand arrows of their thousand
archers.</p>

<p>Before they had time to say a word the
Princess said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good morning, Your Majesties. I am
afraid you have had bad dreams. So have I.
Let us all try to forget them. I hope you will
stay a little longer in my palace. You are
very welcome. I am so sorry you have been
hurt.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We deserved it,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;and we
want to say we have heard the voice of conscience,
and do please forgive us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not another word,&rsquo; said the Princess, &lsquo;<em>do</em>
let me have some fresh tea made. And some
more eggs. These are quite cold. And the
urn&#8217;s been upset. We&#8217;ll have a new breakfast.
And I <em>am</em> so sorry your faces are so
sore.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you kissed them,&rsquo; said the voice which
<a name="png.157" id="png.157"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">120</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the King and Queen called the voice of
conscience, &lsquo;their faces would not be sore any
more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;May I?&rsquo; said Ozyliza, and kissed the
King&#8217;s ear and the Queen&#8217;s nose, all she could
get at through the bandages.</p>

<p>And instantly they were quite well.</p>

<p>They had a delightful breakfast. Then the
King caused the royal household to assemble
in the throne-room, and there announced
that, as the Princess had come to claim the
kingdom, they were returning to their own
kingdom by the three-seventeen train on
Thursday.</p>

<p>Every one cheered like mad, and the whole
town was decorated and illuminated that evening.
Flags flew from every house, and the bells all
rang, just as the Princess had expected them to
do that day when she came home with the
fifty-five camels. All the treasure these had
carried was given back to the Princess, and
the camels themselves were restored to her,
hardly at all the worse for wear.</p>

<p>The usurping King and Queen were seen
off at the station by the Princess, and parted
from her with real affection. You see they
weren&#8217;t completely wicked in their hearts, but
they had never had time to think before. And
being kept awake at night forced them to think.
<a name="png.158" id="png.158"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">121</span><span class="ns">
 </span>And the &lsquo;voice of conscience&rsquo; gave them something
to think about.</p>

<p>They gave the Princess the receipted bills,
with which most of the palace was papered, in
return for board and lodging.</p>

<p>When they were gone a telegram was
sent off.</p>

<div class="blockq">

<p class="i12"><small>Ozymandias Rex, Esq.,<br
 /><span class="i2">Chatsworth,</span><br
 /><span class="i4">Delamere Road,</span><br
 /><span class="i6">Tooting,</span><br
 /><span class="i8">England.</span></small></p>

<p><small>Please come home at once. Palace vacant. Tenants
have left.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Ozyliza P.</span></small></p>
</div>

<p>And they came immediately.</p>

<p>When they arrived the Princess told them
the whole story, and they kissed and praised
her, and called her their deliverer and the
saviour of her country.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>I</em> haven&#8217;t done anything,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;It was
Erinaceus who did everything, and&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But the fairies said,&rsquo; interrupted the King,
who was never clever at the best of times,
&lsquo;that you couldn&#8217;t get the kingdom back till
you had a thousand spears devoted to you, to
you alone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There are a thousand spears in my back,&rsquo;
said a little sharp voice, &lsquo;and they are all
devoted to the Princess and to her alone.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.159" id="png.159"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">122</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t!&rsquo; said the King irritably. &lsquo;That
voice coming out of nothing makes me jump.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&#8217;t get used to it either,&rsquo; said the Queen.
&lsquo;We must have a gold cage built for the little
animal. But I must say I wish it was visible.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said the Princess earnestly. And
instantly it was. I suppose the Princess wished
it very hard, for there was the hedge-pig with
its long spiky body and its little pointed face,
its bright eyes, its small round ears, and its
sharp, turned-up nose.</p>

<p>It looked at the Princess but it did not
speak.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Say something <em>now</em>,&rsquo; said Queen Eliza. &lsquo;I
should like to <em>see</em> a hedge-pig speak.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The truth is, if speak I must, I must speak
the truth,&rsquo; said Erinaceus. &lsquo;The Princess has
thrown away her life-wish to make me visible.
I wish she had wished instead for something
nice for herself.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, was that my life-wish?&rsquo; cried the
Princess. &lsquo;I didn&#8217;t know, dear Hedge-pig, I
didn&#8217;t know. If I&#8217;d only known, I would have
wished you back into your proper shape.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you had,&rsquo; said the hedge-pig, &lsquo;it would
have been the shape of a dead man. Remember
that I have a thousand spears in my back, and
no man can carry those and live.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess burst into tears.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="png.162" id="png.162"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">123</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh, you can&#8217;t go on being a hedge-pig for
ever,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;it&#8217;s not fair. I can&#8217;t bear it.
Oh Mamma! Oh Papa! Oh Benevola!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And there stood Benevola before them, a
little dazzling figure with blue butterfly&#8217;s wings
and a wreath of moonshine.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well?&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;well?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, you know,&rsquo; said the Princess, still
crying. &lsquo;I&#8217;ve thrown away my life-wish, and
he&#8217;s still a hedge-pig. Can&#8217;t you do <em>anything</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>I</em> can&#8217;t,&rsquo; said the Fairy, &lsquo;but you can.
Your kisses are magic kisses. Don&#8217;t you
remember how you cured the King and Queen
of all the wounds the hedge-pig made by
rolling itself on to their faces in the night?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But she can&#8217;t go kissing hedge-pigs,&rsquo; said
the Queen, &lsquo;it would be most unsuitable.
Besides it would hurt her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the hedge-pig raised its little pointed
face, and the Princess took it up in her hands.
She had long since learned how to do this
without hurting either herself or it. She
looked in its little bright eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I would kiss you on every one of your
thousand spears,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;to give you what
you wish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kiss me once,&rsquo; it said, &lsquo;where my fur is
soft. That is all I wish, and enough to live and
die for.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.163" id="png.163"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">124</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She stooped her head and kissed it on its
forehead where the fur is soft, just where the
prickles begin.</p>

<p>And instantly she was standing with her
hands on a young man&#8217;s shoulders and her lips
on a young man&#8217;s face just where the hair
begins and the forehead leaves off. And all
round his feet lay a pile of fallen arrows.</p>

<p>She drew back and looked at him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Erinaceus,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you&#8217;re different&mdash;from
the baker&#8217;s boy I mean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When I was an invisible hedge-pig,&rsquo; he
said, &lsquo;I knew everything. Now I have
forgotten all that wisdom save only two things.
One is that I am a king&#8217;s son. I was stolen
away in infancy by an unprincipled baker, and
I am really the son of that usurping King
whose face I rolled on in the night. It is a
painful thing to roll on your father&#8217;s face when
you are all spiky, but I did it, Princess, for
your sake, and for my father&#8217;s too. And now
I will go to him and tell him all, and ask his
forgiveness.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You won&#8217;t go away?&rsquo; said the Princess.
&lsquo;Ah! don&#8217;t go away. What shall I do without
my hedge-pig?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Erinaceus stood still, looking very handsome
and like a prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is the other thing that you remember
<a name="png.164" id="png.164"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">125</span><span class="ns">
 </span>of your hedge-pig wisdom?&rsquo; asked the Queen
curiously. And Erinaceus answered, not to
her but to the Princess:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The other thing, Princess, is that I love
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Isn&#8217;t there a third thing, Erinaceus?&rsquo; said
the Princess, looking down.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There is, but you must speak that, not I.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the Princess, a little disappointed,
&lsquo;then you knew that I loved you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hedge-pigs are very wise little beasts,&rsquo; said
Erinaceus, &lsquo;but I only knew that when you
told it me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;told you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;When you kissed my little pointed face,
Princess,&rsquo; said Erinaceus, &lsquo;I knew then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My goodness gracious me,&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; said Benevola, &lsquo;and I wouldn&#8217;t
ask <em>any one</em> to the wedding.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Except you, dear,&rsquo; said the Queen.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&lsquo;Well, as I happened to be passing &hellip;
there&#8217;s no time like the present,&rsquo; said Benevola
briskly. &lsquo;Suppose you give orders for the
wedding bells to be rung now, at once!&rsquo;</p>

 /></span><b>V</b><br
 />SEPTIMUS SEPTIMUSSON</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> wind was screaming over the marsh. It
shook the shutters and rattled the windows,
and the little boy lay awake in the bare attic.
His mother came softly up the ladder stairs
shading the flame of the tallow candle with her
hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m not asleep, mother,&rsquo; said he. And she
heard the tears in his voice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, silly lad,&rsquo; she said, sitting down on
the straw-bed beside him and putting the candle
on the floor, &lsquo;what are you crying for?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s the wind keeps calling me, mother,&rsquo; he
said. &lsquo;It won&#8217;t let me alone. It never has
since I put up the little weather-cock for
it to play with. It keeps saying, &ldquo;Wake up,
Septimus Septimusson, wake up, you&#8217;re the
seventh son of a seventh son. You can see
the fairies and hear the beasts speak, and you
must go out and seek your fortune.&rdquo; And I&#8217;m
afraid, and I don&#8217;t want to go.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.166" id="png.166"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">127</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I should think not indeed,&rsquo; said his mother.
&lsquo;The wind doesn&#8217;t talk, Sep, not really. You
just go to sleep like a good boy, and I&#8217;ll get
father to bring you a gingerbread pig from the
fair to-morrow.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Sep lay awake a long time listening to
what the wind really did keep on saying, and
feeling ashamed to think how frightened he
was of going out all alone to seek his fortune&mdash;a
thing all the boys in books were only too
happy to do.</p>

<p>Next evening father brought home the
loveliest gingerbread pig with currant eyes.
Sep ate it, and it made him less anxious than
ever to go out into the world where, perhaps,
no one would give him gingerbread pigs ever
any more.</p>

<p>Before he went to bed he ran down to the
shore where a great new harbour was being
made. The workmen had been blasting the
big rocks, and on one of the rocks a lot of
mussels were sticking. He stood looking at
them, and then suddenly he heard a lot of little
voices crying, &lsquo;Oh Sep, we&#8217;re so frightened,
we&#8217;re choking.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The voices were thin and sharp as the edges
of mussel shells. They were indeed the voices
of the mussels themselves.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dear,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;I&#8217;m so sorry, but I
<a name="png.167" id="png.167"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">128</span><span class="ns">
 </span>can&#8217;t move the rock back into the sea, you
know. Can I now?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the mussels, &lsquo;but if you speak to
the wind,&mdash;you know his language and he&#8217;s
very fond of you since you made that toy for
him,&mdash;he&#8217;ll blow the sea up till the waves
wash us back into deep water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I&#8217;m afraid of the wind,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;it
says things that frighten me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh very well,&rsquo; said the mussels, &lsquo;we
don&#8217;t want you to be afraid. We can die all
right if necessary.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Sep shivered and trembled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go away,&rsquo; said the thin sharp voices.
&lsquo;We&#8217;ll die&mdash;but we&#8217;d rather die in our own
brave company.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know I&#8217;m a coward,&rsquo; said Sep. &lsquo;Oh, wait
a minute.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Death won&#8217;t wait,&rsquo; said the little voices.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&#8217;t speak to the wind, I won&#8217;t,&rsquo; said
Sep, and almost at the same moment he
heard himself call out, &lsquo;Oh wind, please come
and blow up the waves to save the poor
mussels.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wind answered with a boisterous shout&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right, my boy,&rsquo; it shrieked, &lsquo;I&#8217;m
coming.&rsquo; And come it did. And when it had
attended to the mussels it came and whispered
to Sep in his attic. And to his great surprise,
<a name="png.168" id="png.168"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">129</span><span class="ns">
 </span>instead of covering his head with the bed-clothes,
as usual, and trying not to listen, he
found himself sitting up in bed and talking to
the wind, man to man.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I&#8217;m not afraid of you any
more.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course not, we&#8217;re friends now,&rsquo; said the
wind. &lsquo;That&#8217;s because we joined together to
do a kindness to some one. There&#8217;s nothing
like that for making people friends.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Sep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the wind, &lsquo;and now, old chap,
when will you go out and seek your fortune?
Remember how poor your father is, and the
fortune, if you find it, won&#8217;t be just for you,
but for your father and mother and the others.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;I didn&#8217;t think of that.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the wind, &lsquo;really, my dear
fellow, I do hate to bother you, but it&#8217;s better
to fix a time. Now when shall we start?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We?&rsquo; said Sep. &lsquo;Are you going with me?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll see you a bit of the way,&rsquo; said the wind.
&lsquo;What do you say now? Shall we start
to-night? There&#8217;s no time like the present.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do hate going,&rsquo; said Sep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you do!&rsquo; said the wind, cordially.
&lsquo;Come along. Get into your things, and we&#8217;ll
make a beginning.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Sep dressed, and he wrote on his slate in
<a name="png.169" id="png.169"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">130</span><span class="ns">
 </span>very big letters, &lsquo;Gone to seek our fortune,&rsquo;
and he put it on the table so that his mother
should see it when she came down in the
morning. And he went out of the cottage
and the wind kindly shut the door after him.</p>

<p>The wind gently pushed him down to the
shore, and there he got into his father&#8217;s boat,
which was called the <i>Septimus and Susie</i>, after
his father and mother, and the wind carried him
across to another country and there he landed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the wind, clapping him on the
back, &lsquo;off you go, and good luck to you!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And it turned round and took the boat
home again.</p>

<p>When Sep&#8217;s mother found the writing on the
slate, and his father found the boat gone they
feared that Sep was drowned, but when the
wind brought the boat back wrong way up,
they were quite sure, and they both cried for
many a long day.</p>

<p>The wind tried to tell them that Sep was
all right, but they couldn&#8217;t understand wind-talk,
and they only said, &lsquo;Drat the wind,&rsquo; and
fastened the shutters up tight, and put wedges
in the windows.</p>

<p>Sep walked along the straight white road
that led across the new country. He had no
more idea how to look for <em>his</em> fortune than you
would have if you suddenly left off reading
<a name="png.170" id="png.170"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">131</span><span class="ns">
 </span>this and went out of your front door to seek
<em>yours</em>.</p>

<p>However, he had made a start, and that is
always something. When he had gone exactly
seven miles on that straight foreign road,
between strange trees, and bordered with
flowers he did not know the names of, he
heard a groaning in the wood, and some one
sighing and saying, &lsquo;Oh, how hard it is, to
have to die and never see my wife and the
little cubs again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The voice was rough as a lion&#8217;s mane, and
strong as a lion&#8217;s claws, and Sep was very
frightened. But he said, &lsquo;I&#8217;m not afraid,&rsquo; and
then oddly enough he found he had spoken the
truth&mdash;he wasn&#8217;t afraid.</p>

<p>He broke through the bushes and found
that the person who had spoken was indeed a
lion. A javelin had pierced its shoulder and
fastened it to a great tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; cried Sep, &lsquo;hold still a minute,
sir.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He got out his knife and cut and cut at the
shaft of the javelin till he was able to break it
off. Then the lion drew back and the broken
shaft passed through the wound and the broken
javelin was left sticking in the tree.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m really extremely obliged, my dear
fellow,&rsquo; said the lion warmly. &lsquo;Pray command
<a name="png.171" id="png.171"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">132</span><span class="ns">
 </span>me, if there&#8217;s any little thing I can do for you
at any time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t mention it,&rsquo; said Sep with proper
politeness, &lsquo;delighted to have been of use
to you, I&#8217;m sure.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they parted. As Sep scrambled through
the bushes back to the road he kicked against
an axe that lay on the ground.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hullo,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;some poor woodman&#8217;s
dropped this, and not been able to find it. I&#8217;ll
take it along&mdash;perhaps I may meet him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was getting very tired and very hungry,
and presently he sat down to rest under a
chestnut-tree, and he heard two little voices
talking in the branches, voices soft as a squirrel&#8217;s
fur, and bright as a squirrel&#8217;s eyes. They
were, indeed, the voices of two squirrels.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hush,&rsquo; said one, &lsquo;there&#8217;s some one below.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said the other, &lsquo;it&#8217;s a horrid boy.
Let&#8217;s scurry away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m not a horrid boy,&rsquo; said Sep. &lsquo;I&#8217;m the
seventh son of a seventh son.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said Mrs. Squirrel, &lsquo;of course that
makes all the difference. Have some nuts?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Rather,&rsquo; said Sep. &lsquo;At least I mean, yes,
if you please.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the squirrels brought nuts down to him,
and when he had eaten as many as he wanted
they filled his pockets, and then in return he
<a name="png.172" id="png.172"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">133</span><span class="ns">
 </span>chopped all the lower boughs off the chestnut-tree,
so that boys who were <em>not</em> seventh sons
could not climb up and interfere with the
squirrels&#8217; housekeeping arrangements.</p>

<p>Then they parted, the best of friends, and
Sep went on.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I haven&#8217;t found my fortune yet,&rsquo; said he,
&lsquo;but I&#8217;ve made a friend or two.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And just as he was saying that, he turned a
corner of the road and met an old gentleman
in a fur-lined coat riding a fine, big, grey horse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hullo!&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;Who are you,
and where are you off to so bright and early?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m Septimus Septimusson,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;and
I&#8217;m going to seek my fortune.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And you&#8217;ve taken an axe to help you carve
your way to glory?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;I found it, and I suppose
some one lost it. So I&#8217;m bringing it along in
case I meet him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Heavy, isn&#8217;t it?&rsquo; said the old gentleman.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Sep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I&#8217;ll carry it for you,&rsquo; said the old
gentleman, &lsquo;for it&#8217;s one that my head forester
lost yesterday. And now come along with me,
for you&#8217;re the boy I&#8217;ve been looking for for
seven years&mdash;an honest boy and the seventh
son of a seventh son.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Sep went home with the gentleman, who
<a name="png.173" id="png.173"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">134</span><span class="ns">
 </span>was a great lord in that country, and he lived
in that lord&#8217;s castle and was taught everything
that a gentleman ought to know. And in
return he told the lord all about the ways of
birds and beasts&mdash;for as he understood their
talk he knew more about them than any one
else in that country. And the lord wrote it
all down in a book, and half the people said it
was wonderfully clever, and the other half said
it was nonsense, and how could he know. This
was fame, and the lord was very pleased.
But though the old lord was so famous he
would not leave his castle, for he had a hump
that an enchanter had fastened on to him, and
he couldn&#8217;t bear to be seen with it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you&#8217;ll get rid of it for me some day,
my boy,&rsquo; he used to say. &lsquo;No one but the
seventh son of a seventh son and an honest boy
can do it. So all the doctors say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Sep grew up. And when he was
twenty-one&mdash;straight as a lance and handsome
as a picture&mdash;the old lord said to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My boy, you&#8217;ve been like a son to me, but
now it&#8217;s time you got married and had sons of
your own. Is there any girl you&#8217;d like to
marry?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;I never did care much for
girls.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The old lord laughed.</p>

<p><a name="png.174" id="png.174"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">135</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Then you must set out again and seek your
fortune once more,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;because no man
has really found his fortune till he&#8217;s found the
lady who is his heart&#8217;s lady. Choose the best
horse in the stable, and off you go, lad, and my
blessing go with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Sep <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'choose'">chose</ins> a good red horse and set out,
and he rode straight to the great city, that
shone golden across the plain, and when he got
there he found every one crying.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, whatever is the matter?&rsquo; said Sep,
reining in the red horse in front of a smithy,
where the apprentices were crying on to the fires,
and the smith was dropping tears on the anvil.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why the Princess is dying,&rsquo; said the blacksmith
blowing his nose. &lsquo;A nasty, wicked
magician&mdash;he had a spite against the King, and
he got at the Princess when she was playing
ball in the garden, and now she&#8217;s blind and
deaf and dumb. And she won&#8217;t eat.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And she&#8217;ll die,&rsquo; said the first apprentice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And she <em>is</em> such a dear,&rsquo; said the other
apprentice.</p>

<p>Sep sat still on the red horse thinking.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Has anything been done?&rsquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said the blacksmith. &lsquo;All the
doctors have seen her, but they can&#8217;t do anything.
And the King has advertised in the
usual way, that any one who can cure her may
<a name="png.175" id="png.175"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">136</span><span class="ns">
 </span>marry her. But it&#8217;s no good. King&#8217;s sons
aren&#8217;t what they used to be. A silly lot they
are nowadays, all taken up with football and
cricket and golf.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;thank you. Which
is the way to the palace?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The blacksmith pointed, and then burst into
tears again. Sep rode on.</p>

<p>When he got to the palace he asked to see
the King. Every one there was crying too, from
the footman who opened the door to the King,
who was sitting upon his golden throne and
looking at his fine collection of butterflies
through floods of tears.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dear me yes, young man,&rsquo; said the King,
&lsquo;you may <em>see</em> her and welcome, but it&#8217;s no good.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We can but try,&rsquo; said Sep. So he was
taken to the room where the Princess sat
huddled up on her silver throne among the
white velvet cushions with her crown all on one
side, crying out of her poor blind eyes, so that
the tears ran down over her green gown with
the red roses on it.</p>

<p>And directly he saw her he knew that she
was the only girl, Princess as she was, with
a crown and a throne, who could ever be his
heart&#8217;s lady. He went up to her and kneeled
at her side and took her hand and kissed it.
The Princess started. She could not see or
<a name="png.176" id="png.176"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">137</span><span class="ns">
 </span>hear him, but at the touch of his hand and his
lips she knew that he was her heart&#8217;s lord, and
she threw her arms round his neck, and cried
more than ever.</p>

<p>He held her in his arms and stroked her
hair till she stopped crying, and then he called
for bread and milk. This was brought in a
silver basin, and he fed her with it as you feed
a little child.</p>

<p>The news ran through the city, &lsquo;The
Princess has eaten,&rsquo; and all the bells were set
ringing. Sep said good-night to his Princess
and went to bed in the best bedroom of the
palace. Early in the grey morning he got up
and leaned out of the open window and called
to his old friend the wind.</p>

<p>And the wind came bustling in and clapped
him on the back, crying, &lsquo;Well, my boy, and
what can I do for you? Eh?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sep told him all about the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the wind, &lsquo;you&#8217;ve not done so
badly. At any rate you&#8217;ve got her love. And
you couldn&#8217;t have got that with anybody&#8217;s help
but your own. Now, of course, the thing to do
is to find the wicked Magician.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; said Sep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well&mdash;I travel a good deal&mdash;I&#8217;ll keep my
eyes open, and let you know if I hear anything.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sep spent the day holding the Princess&#8217;s
<a name="png.177" id="png.177"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">138</span><span class="ns">
 </span>hand, and feeding her at meal times; and that
night the wind rattled his window and said,
&lsquo;Let me in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It came in very noisily, and said, &lsquo;Well,
I&#8217;ve found your Magician, he&#8217;s in the forest
pretending to be a mole.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How can I find him?&rsquo; said Sep.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Haven&#8217;t you any friends in the forest?&rsquo;
asked the wind.</p>

<p>Then Sep remembered his friends the
squirrels, and he mounted his horse and rode
away to the chestnut-tree where they lived.
They were charmed to see him grown so tall
and strong and handsome, and when he had
told them his story they said at once&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes! delighted to be of any service to
you.&rsquo; And they called to all their little brothers
and cousins, and uncles and nephews to search
the forest for a mole that wasn&#8217;t really a mole,
and quite soon they found him, and hustled and
shoved him along till he was face to face with
Sep, in a green glade. The glade was green,
but all the bushes and trees around were red-brown
with squirrel fur, and shining bright
with squirrel eyes.</p>

<p>Then Sep said, &lsquo;Give the Princess back her
eyes and her hearing and her voice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the mole would not.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Give the Princess back her eyes and her
<a name="png.178" id="png.178"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">139</span><span class="ns">
 </span>hearing and her voice,&rsquo; said Sep again. But
the mole only gnashed his wicked teeth and
snarled.</p>

<p>And then in a minute the squirrels fell on
the mole and killed it, and Sep thanked them
and rode back to the palace, for, of course, he
knew that when a magician is killed, all his
magic unworks itself instantly.</p>

<p>But when he got to his Princess she was
still as deaf as a post and as dumb as a stone,
and she was still crying bitterly with her poor
blind eyes, till the tears ran down her grass-green
gown with the red roses on it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Cheer up, my sweetheart,&rsquo; he said, though
he knew she couldn&#8217;t hear him, and as he
spoke the wind came in at the open window,
and spoke very softly, because it was in the
presence of the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right,&rsquo; it whispered, &lsquo;the old villain
gave us the slip that journey. Got out of the
mole-skin in the very nick of time. He&#8217;s a
wild boar now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Sep, fingering his sword-hilt,
&lsquo;I&#8217;ll kill that myself without asking it any
questions.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went and fought it. But it was a
most uncommon boar, as big as a horse, with
tusks half a yard long; and although Sep
wounded it it jerked the sword out of his hand
<a name="png.179" id="png.179"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">140</span><span class="ns">
 </span>with its tusk, and was just going to trample
him out of life with its hard, heavy pigs&#8217;-feet,
when a great roar sounded through the forest.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! would ye?&rsquo; said the lion, and fastened
teeth and claws in the great boar&#8217;s back. The
boar turned with a scream of rage, but the lion
had got a good grip, and it did not loosen teeth
or claws till the boar lay quiet.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is he dead?&rsquo; asked Sep when he came to
himself.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, he&#8217;s <em>dead</em> right enough,&rsquo; said the
lion; but the wind came up puffing and blowing,
and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s no good, he&#8217;s got away again, and now
he&#8217;s a fish. I was just a minute too late to see
<em>what</em> fish. An old oyster told me about it,
only he hadn&#8217;t the wit to notice what particular
fish the scoundrel changed into.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So then Sep went back to the palace, and
he said to the King:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me marry the dear Princess, and we&#8217;ll
go out and seek our fortune. I&#8217;ve got to kill
that Magician, and I&#8217;ll do it too, or my name&#8217;s
not Septimus Septimusson. But it may take
years and years, and I can&#8217;t be away from the
Princess all that time, because she won&#8217;t eat
unless I feed her. You see the difficulty,
Sire?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King saw it. And that very day Sep
<a name="png.180" id="png.180"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">141</span><span class="ns">
 </span>was married to the Princess in her green gown
with the red roses on it, and they set out
together.</p>

<p>The wind went with them, and the wind, or
something else, seemed to say to Sep, &lsquo;Go
home, take your wife home to your mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he did. He crossed the land and he
crossed the sea, and he went up the red-brick
path to his father&#8217;s cottage, and he peeped in
at the door and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father, mother, here&#8217;s my wife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They were so pleased to see him&mdash;for they
had thought him dead, that they didn&#8217;t notice
the Princess at first, and when they did notice
her they wondered at her beautiful face and
her beautiful gown&mdash;but it wasn&#8217;t till they had
all settled down to supper&mdash;boiled rabbit it was&mdash;and
they noticed Sep feeding his wife as one
feeds a baby that they saw that she was
blind.</p>

<p>And then all the story had to be told.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the fisherman, &lsquo;you and
your wife bide here with us. I daresay I&#8217;ll
catch that old sinner in my nets one of these
fine days.&rsquo; But he never did. And Sep and
his wife lived with the old people. And they
were happy after a fashion&mdash;but of an evening
Sep used to wander and wonder, and wonder
and wander by the sea-shore, wondering as he
<a name="png.181" id="png.181"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">142</span><span class="ns">
 </span>wandered whether he wouldn&#8217;t ever have the
luck to catch that fish.</p>

<p>And one evening as he wandered wondering
he heard a little, sharp, thin voice say:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sep. I&#8217;ve got it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What?&rsquo; asked Sep, forgetting his manners.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ve got it,&rsquo; said a big mussel on a rock
close by him, &lsquo;the magic stone that the
Magician does his enchantments with. He
dropped it out of his mouth and I shut my
shells on it&mdash;and now he&#8217;s sweeping up and
down the sea like a mad fish, looking for it&mdash;for
he knows he can never change into anything
else unless he gets it back. Here, take
the nasty thing, it&#8217;s making me feel quite ill.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It opened its shells wide, and Sep saw a
pearl. He reached out his hand and took it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s better,&rsquo; said the mussel, washing its
shells out with salt water.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can <em>I</em> do magic with it?&rsquo; Sep eagerly
asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the mussel sadly, &lsquo;it&#8217;s of no use
to any one but the owner. Now, if I were you,
I&#8217;d get into a boat, and if your friend the wind
will help us, I believe we really can do the trick.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m at your service, of course,&rsquo; said the
wind, getting up instantly.</p>

<p>The mussel whispered to the wind, who
rushed off at once; and Sep launched his boat.</p>

<p><a name="png.182" id="png.182"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">143</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the mussel, &lsquo;you get into the
very middle of the sea&mdash;or as near as you can
guess it. The wind will warn all the other
fishes.&rsquo; As he spoke he disappeared in the
dark waters.</p>

<p>Sep got the boat into the middle of the sea&mdash;as
near as he could guess it&mdash;and waited.</p>

<p>After a long time he saw something swirling
about in a sort of whirlpool about a hundred
yards from his boat, but when he tried to move
the boat towards it her bows ran on to something
hard.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Keep still, keep still, keep still,&rsquo; cried
thousands and thousands of sharp, thin, little
voices. &lsquo;You&#8217;ll kill us if you move.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then he looked over the boat side, and saw
that the hard something was nothing but
thousands and thousands of mussels all jammed
close together, and through the clear water
more and more were coming and piling themselves
together. Almost at once his boat was
slowly lifted&mdash;the top of the mussel heap showed
through the water, and there he was, high and
dry on a mussel reef.</p>

<p>And in all that part of the sea the water was
disappearing, and as far as the eye could reach
stretched a great plain of purple and gray&mdash;the
shells of countless mussels.</p>

<p>Only at one spot there was still a splashing.</p>

<p><a name="png.183" id="png.183"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">144</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Then a mussel opened its shell and spoke.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We&#8217;ve got him,&rsquo; it said. &lsquo;We&#8217;ve piled our
selves up till we&#8217;ve filled this part of the sea.
The wind warned all the good fishes&mdash;and
we&#8217;ve got the old traitor in a little pool over
there. Get out and walk over our backs&mdash;we&#8217;ll
all lie sideways so as not to hurt you. You
must catch the fish&mdash;but whatever you do don&#8217;t
kill it till we give the word.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sep promised, and he got out and walked
over the mussels to the pool, and when he saw
the wicked soul of the Magician looking out
through the round eyes of a big finny fish he
remembered all that his Princess had suffered,
and he longed to draw his sword and kill the
wicked thing then and there.</p>

<p>But he remembered his promise. He threw
a net about it, and dragged it back to the
boat.</p>

<p>The mussels dispersed and let the boat down
again into the water&mdash;and he rowed home,
towing the evil fish in the net by a line.</p>

<p>He beached the boat, and looked along the
shore. The shore looked a very odd colour.
And well it might, for every bit of the sand
was covered with purple-gray mussels. They
had all come up out of the sea&mdash;leaving just
one little bit of real yellow sand for him to
beach the boat on.</p>

<p><a name="png.184" id="png.184"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">145</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said millions of sharp thin little
voices, &lsquo;Kill him, kill him!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sep drew his sword and waded into the
shallow surf and killed the evil fish with one
strong stroke.</p>

<p>Then such a shout went up all along the
shore as that shore had never heard; and all
along the shore where the mussels had been,
stood men in armour and men in smock-frocks
and men in leather aprons and huntsmen&#8217;s coats
and women and children&mdash;a whole nation of
people. Close by the boat stood a King and
Queen with crowns upon their heads.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you, Sep,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;you&#8217;ve
saved us all. I am the King Mussel, doomed
to be a mussel so long as that wretch lived.
You have set us all free. And look!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Down the path from the shore came running
his own Princess, who hung round his neck
crying his name and looking at him with the
most beautiful eyes in the world.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said the Mussel King, &lsquo;we have no
son. You shall be our son and reign after us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said Sep, &lsquo;but <em>this</em> is my father,&rsquo;
and he presented the old fisherman to His
Majesty.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then let him come with us,&rsquo; said the King
royally, &lsquo;he can help me reign, or fish in the
palace lake, whichever he prefers.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.185" id="png.185"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">146</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Thankee,&rsquo; said Sep&#8217;s father, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll come and
fish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your mother too,&rsquo; said the Mussel Queen,
kissing Sep&#8217;s mother.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said Sep&#8217;s mother, &lsquo;you&#8217;re a lady,
every inch. I&#8217;ll go to the world&#8217;s end with
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they all went back by way of the foreign
country where Sep had found his Princess, and
they called on the old lord. He had lost his
hump, and they easily persuaded him to come
with them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You can help me reign if you like, or we
have a nice book or two in the palace library,&rsquo;
said the Mussel King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; said the old lord, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll come and
be your librarian if I may. Reigning isn&#8217;t at
all in my line.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they went on to Sep&#8217;s father-in-law,
and when he saw how happy they all were
together he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bless my beard but I&#8217;ve half a mind to
come with you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come along,&rsquo; said the Mussel King, &lsquo;you
shall help me reign if you like &hellip; or&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said the other King very
quickly, &lsquo;I&#8217;ve had enough of reigning. My
kingdom can buy a President and be a republic
if it likes. I&#8217;m going to catch butterflies.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.186" id="png.186"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">147</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And so he does, most happily, up to this
very minute.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">And Sep and his dear Princess are as happy
as they deserve to be. Some people say we
are all as happy as we deserve to be&mdash;but I am
not sure.</p>




<h2><a name="png.187" id="png.187"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">148</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><b>VI</b><br
 />THE WHITE CAT</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> White Cat lived at the back of a shelf at
the darkest end of the inside attic which was
nearly dark all over. It had lived there for
years, because one of its white china ears was
chipped, so that it was no longer a possible
ornament for the spare bedroom.</p>

<p>Tavy found it at the climax of a wicked and
glorious afternoon. He had been left alone.
The servants were the only other people in the
house. He had promised to be good. He
had meant to be good. And he had not been.
He had done everything you can think of.
He had walked into the duck pond, and not a
stitch of his clothes but had had to be changed.
He had climbed on a hay rick and fallen off it,
and had not broken his neck, which, as cook
told him, he richly deserved to do. He had
found a mouse in the trap and put it in the
kitchen tea-pot, so that when cook went to
make tea it jumped out at her, and affected
<a name="png.188" id="png.188"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">149</span><span class="ns">
 </span>her to screams followed by tears. Tavy was
sorry for this, of course, and said so like a man.
He had only, he explained, meant to give her
a little start. In the confusion that followed
the mouse, he had eaten all the black-currant
jam that was put out for kitchen tea, and
for this too, he apologised handsomely as
soon as it was pointed out to him. He had
broken a pane of the greenhouse with a stone
and&hellip;. But why pursue the painful theme?
The last thing he had done was to explore
the attic, where he was never allowed to go,
and to knock down the White Cat from its
shelf.</p>

<p>The sound of its fall brought the servants.
The cat was not broken&mdash;only its other ear
was chipped. Tavy was put to bed. But he
got out as soon as the servants had gone downstairs,
crept up to the attic, secured the Cat, and
washed it in the bath. So that when mother
came back from London, Tavy, dancing impatiently
at the head of the stairs, in a very
wet night-gown, flung himself upon her and
cried, &lsquo;I&#8217;ve been awfully naughty, and I&#8217;m
frightfully sorry, and please may I have the
White Cat for my very own?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was much sorrier than he had expected
to be when he saw that mother was too tired
even to want to know, as she generally did,
<a name="png.189" id="png.189"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">150</span><span class="ns">
 </span>exactly how naughty he had been. She only
kissed him, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I am sorry you&#8217;ve been naughty, my darling.
Go back to bed now. Good-night.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tavy was ashamed to say anything more
about the China Cat, so he went back to bed.
But he took the Cat with him, and talked to it
and kissed it, and went to sleep with its smooth
shiny shoulder against his cheek.</p>

<p>In the days that followed, he was extravagantly
good. Being good seemed as easy
as being bad usually was. This may have
been because mother seemed so tired and ill;
and gentlemen in black coats and high hats
came to see mother, and after they had gone
she used to cry. (These things going on in a
house sometimes make people good; sometimes
they act just the other way.) Or it may have
been because he had the China Cat to talk to.
Anyhow, whichever way it was, at the end of
the week mother said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tavy, you&#8217;ve been a dear good boy, and a
great comfort to me. You must have tried
very hard to be good.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It was difficult to say, &lsquo;No, I haven&#8217;t, at
least not since the first day,&rsquo; but Tavy got it
said, and was hugged for his pains.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You wanted,&rsquo; said mother, &lsquo;the China Cat.
Well, you may have it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.190" id="png.190"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">151</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;For my very own?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;For your very own. But you must be
very careful not to break it. And you mustn&#8217;t
give it away. It goes with the house. Your
Aunt Jane made me promise to keep it in the
family. It&#8217;s very, very old. Don&#8217;t take it out
of doors for fear of accidents.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I love the White Cat, mother,&rsquo; said Tavy.
&lsquo;I love it better&#8217;n all my toys.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then mother told Tavy several things, and
that night when he went to bed Tavy repeated
them all faithfully to the China Cat, who was
about six inches high and looked very intelligent.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So you see,&rsquo; he ended, &lsquo;the wicked lawyer&#8217;s
taken nearly all mother&#8217;s money, and we&#8217;ve
got to leave our own lovely big White House,
and go and live in a horrid little house with
another house glued on to its side. And mother
does hate it so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t wonder,&rsquo; said the China Cat very
distinctly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>What!</em>&rsquo; said Tavy, half-way into his night-shirt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I said, I don&#8217;t wonder, Octavius,&rsquo; said
the China Cat, and rose from her sitting position,
stretched her china legs and waved her white
china tail.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You can speak?&rsquo; said Tavy.</p>

<p><a name="png.191" id="png.191"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">152</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Can&#8217;t you see I can?&mdash;hear I mean?&rsquo; said
the Cat. &lsquo;I belong to you now, so I can speak
to you. I couldn&#8217;t before. It wouldn&#8217;t have
been manners.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tavy, his night-shirt round his neck, sat
down on the edge of the bed with his mouth
open.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, don&#8217;t look so silly,&rsquo; said the Cat,
taking a walk along the high wooden mantelpiece,
&lsquo;any one would think you didn&#8217;t <em>like</em> me
to talk to you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I <em>love</em> you to,&rsquo; said Tavy recovering himself
a little.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well then,&rsquo; said the Cat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;May I touch you?&rsquo; Tavy asked timidly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course! I belong to you. Look out!&rsquo;
The China Cat gathered herself together and
jumped. Tavy caught her.</p>

<p>It was quite a shock to find when one stroked
her that the China Cat, though alive, was still
china, hard, cold, and smooth to the touch, and
yet perfectly brisk and absolutely bendable as
any flesh and blood cat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear, dear white pussy,&rsquo; said Tavy, &lsquo;I do
love you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And I love you,&rsquo; purred the Cat, &lsquo;otherwise
I should never have lowered myself to
begin a conversation.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish you were a real cat,&rsquo; said Tavy.</p>

<p><a name="png.192" id="png.192"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">153</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said the Cat. &lsquo;Now how shall we
amuse ourselves? I suppose you don&#8217;t care
for sport&mdash;mousing, I mean?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I never tried,&rsquo; said Tavy, &lsquo;and I think I
rather wouldn&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well then, Octavius,&rsquo; said the Cat.
&lsquo;I&#8217;ll take you to the White Cat&#8217;s Castle. Get
into bed. Bed makes a good travelling carriage,
especially when you haven&#8217;t any other. Shut
your eyes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tavy did as he was told. Shut his eyes,
but could not keep them shut. He opened
them a tiny, tiny chink, and sprang up. He
was not in bed. He was on a couch of soft
beast-skin, and the couch stood in a splendid
hall, whose walls were of gold and ivory. By
him stood the White Cat, no longer china, but
real live cat&mdash;and fur&mdash;as cats should be.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here we are,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;The journey
didn&#8217;t take long, did it? Now we&#8217;ll have that
splendid supper, out of the fairy tale, with the
invisible hands waiting on us.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She clapped her paws&mdash;paws now as soft as
white velvet&mdash;and a table-cloth floated into the
room; then knives and forks and spoons and
glasses, the table was laid, the dishes drifted
in, and they began to eat. There happened to
be every single thing Tavy liked best to eat.
After supper there was music and singing, and
<a name="png.193" id="png.193"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">154</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Tavy, having kissed a white, soft, furry forehead,
went to bed in a gold four-poster with a counterpane
of butterflies&#8217; wings. He awoke at home.
On the mantelpiece sat the White Cat, looking
as though butter would not melt in her mouth.
And all her furriness had gone with her voice.
She was silent&mdash;and china.</p>

<p>Tavy spoke to her. But she would not
answer. Nor did she speak all day. Only at
night when he was getting into bed she suddenly
mewed, stretched, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Make haste, there&#8217;s a play acted to-night
at my castle.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tavy made haste, and was rewarded by
another glorious evening in the castle of the
White Cat.</p>

<p>And so the weeks went on. Days full of an
ordinary little boy&#8217;s joys and sorrows, goodnesses
and badnesses. Nights spent by a little
Prince in the Magic Castle of the White Cat.</p>

<p>Then came the day when Tavy&#8217;s mother
spoke to him, and he, very scared and serious,
told the China Cat what she had said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I knew this would happen,&rsquo; said the Cat.
&lsquo;It always does. So you&#8217;re to leave your house
next week. Well, there&#8217;s only one way out of
the difficulty. Draw your sword, Tavy, and
cut off my head and tail.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And then will you turn into a Princess, and
<a name="png.194" id="png.194"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">155</span><span class="ns">
 </span>shall I have to marry you?&rsquo; Tavy asked
with horror.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, dear&mdash;no,&rsquo; said the Cat reassuringly.
&lsquo;I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t turn into anything. But you and
mother will turn into happy people. I shall
just not <em>be</em> any more&mdash;for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I won&#8217;t do it,&rsquo; said Tavy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you must. Come, draw your sword,
like a brave fairy Prince, and cut off my head.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The sword hung above his bed, with the
helmet and breast-plate Uncle James had
given him last Christmas.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m not a fairy Prince,&rsquo; said the child.
&lsquo;I&#8217;m Tavy&mdash;and I love you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You love your mother better,&rsquo; said the Cat.
&lsquo;Come cut my head off. The story always
ends like that. You love mother best. It&#8217;s
for her sake.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Tavy was trying to think it out.
&lsquo;Yes, I love mother best. But I love <em>you</em>.
And I won&#8217;t cut off your head,&mdash;no, not even
for mother.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the Cat, &lsquo;I must do what I
can!&rsquo;</p>

<p>She stood up, waving her white china tail,
and before Tavy could stop her she had leapt,
not, as before, into his arms, but on to the wide
hearthstone.</p>

<p>It was all over&mdash;the China Cat lay broken <!-- Transcriber's note: original reads "The" -->
<a name="png.195" id="png.195"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">156</span><span class="ns">
 </span>inside the high brass fender. The sound of
the smash brought mother running.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Oh, Tavy&mdash;the
China Cat!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She would do it,&rsquo; sobbed Tavy. &lsquo;She
wanted me to cut off her head&#8217;n I wouldn&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense, dear,&rsquo; said mother
sadly. &lsquo;That only makes it worse. Pick up
the pieces.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&#8217;s only two pieces,&rsquo; said Tavy.
&lsquo;Couldn&#8217;t you stick her together again?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why,&rsquo; said mother, holding the pieces
close to the candle. &lsquo;She&#8217;s been broken before.
And mended.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I knew that,&rsquo; said Tavy, still sobbing.
&lsquo;Oh, my dear White Cat, oh, oh, oh!&rsquo; The
last &lsquo;oh&rsquo; was a howl of anguish.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come, crying won&#8217;t mend her,&rsquo; said mother.
&lsquo;Look, there&#8217;s another piece of her, close to
the shovel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tavy stooped.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s not a piece of cat,&rsquo; he said, and
picked it up.</p>

<p>It was a pale parchment label, tied to a key.
Mother held it to the candle and read: &lsquo;<i>Key
of the lock behind the knot in the mantelpiece
panel in the white parlour.</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tavy! I wonder! But &hellip; where did it
come from?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.196" id="png.196"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">157</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Out of my White Cat, I s&#8217;pose,&rsquo; said Tavy,
his tears stopping. &lsquo;Are you going to see
what&#8217;s in the mantelpiece panel, mother?
Are you? Oh, do let me come and see
too!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You don&#8217;t deserve,&rsquo; mother began, and
ended,&mdash;&lsquo;Well, put your dressing-gown on
then.&rsquo;</p>

<p>They went down the gallery past the pictures
and the stuffed birds and tables with china on
them and downstairs on to the white parlour.
But they could not see any knot in the mantelpiece
panel, because it was all painted white.
But mother&#8217;s fingers felt softly all over it, and
found a round raised spot. It was a knot,
sure enough. Then she scraped round it with
her scissors, till she loosened the knot, and
poked it out with the scissors point.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t suppose there&#8217;s any keyhole there
really,&rsquo; she said. But there was. And what
is more, the key fitted. The panel swung open,
and inside was a little cupboard with two
shelves. What was on the shelves? There
were old laces and old embroideries, old
jewelry and old silver; there was money, and
there were dusty old papers that Tavy thought
most uninteresting. But mother did not think
them uninteresting. She laughed, and cried,
or nearly cried, and said:</p>

<p><a name="png.197" id="png.197"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">158</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh, Tavy, this was why the China Cat
was to be taken such care of!&rsquo; Then she told
him how, a hundred and fifty years before, the
Head of the House had gone out to fight for
the Pretender, and had told his daughter to
take the greatest care of the China Cat. &lsquo;I
will send you word of the reason by a sure
hand,&rsquo; he said, for they parted on the open
square, where any spy might have overheard
anything. And he had been killed by an
ambush not ten miles from home,&mdash;and his
daughter had never known. But she had kept
the Cat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And now it has saved us,&rsquo; said mother.
&lsquo;We can stay in the dear old house, and there
are two other houses that will belong to us too,
I think. And, oh, Tavy, would you like some
pound-cake and ginger-wine, dear?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Tavy did like. And had it.</p>

<p>The China Cat was mended, but it was
put in the glass-fronted corner cupboard in
the drawing-room, because it had saved the
House.</p>

<p>Now I dare say you&#8217;ll think this is all nonsense,
and a made-up story. Not at all. If it
were, how would you account for Tavy&#8217;s finding,
the very next night, fast asleep on his
pillow, his own white Cat&mdash;the furry friend
that the China Cat used to turn into every
<a name="png.198" id="png.198"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">159</span><span class="ns">
 </span>evening&mdash;the dear hostess who had amused
him so well in the White Cat&#8217;s fairy Palace?</p>

<p class="pgbrk">It was she, beyond a doubt, and that was
why Tavy didn&#8217;t mind a bit about the China
Cat being taken from him and kept under
glass. You may think that it was just any old
stray white cat that had come in by accident.
Tavy knows better. It has the very same
tender tone in its purr that the magic White Cat
had. It will not talk to Tavy, it is true; but
Tavy can and does talk to it. But the thing
that makes it perfectly certain that it is the
White Cat is that the tips of its two ears are
missing&mdash;just as the China Cat&#8217;s ears were. If
you say that it might have lost its ear-tips in
battle you are the kind of person who always
<em>makes</em> difficulties, and you may be quite sure
that the kind of splendid magics that happened
to Tavy will never happen to <em>you</em>.</p>

 /></span><b>VII</b><br
 />BELINDA AND BELLAMANT; OR<br
 />THE BELLS OF CARRILLON-LAND</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">There</span> is a certain country where a king is
never allowed to reign while a queen can be
found. They like queens much better than
kings in that country. I can&#8217;t think why. If
some one has tried to teach you a little history,
you will perhaps think that this is the Salic law.
But it isn&#8217;t. In the biggest city of that odd
country there is a great bell-tower (higher
than the clock-tower of the Houses of Parliament,
where they put M.P.&#8217;s who forget
their manners). This bell-tower had seven
bells in it, very sweet-toned splendid bells,
made expressly to ring on the joyful occasions
when a princess was born who would be queen
some day. And the great tower was built
expressly for the bells to ring in. So you see
what a lot they thought of queens in that
country. Now in all the bells there are bell-people&mdash;it
is their voices that you hear when
<a name="png.200" id="png.200"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">161</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the bells ring. All that about its being the
clapper of the bell is mere nonsense, and would
hardly deceive a child. I don&#8217;t know why
people say such things. Most Bell-people are
very energetic busy folk, who love the sound of
their own voices, and hate being idle, and
when nearly two hundred years had gone by,
and no princesses had been born, they got tired
of living in bells that were never rung. So
they slipped out of the belfry one fine frosty
night, and left the big beautiful bells empty,
and went off to find other homes. One of
them went to live in a dinner-bell, and one in a
school-bell, and the rest all found homes&mdash;they
did not mind where&mdash;just anywhere, in fact,
where they could find any Bell-person kind
enough to give them board and lodging. And
every one was surprised at the increased loudness
in the voices of these hospitable bells. For,
of course, the Bell-people from the belfry did
their best to help in the housework as polite
guests should, and always added their voices
to those of their hosts on all occasions when
bell-talk was called for. And the seven big
beautiful bells in the belfry were left hollow
and dark and quite empty, except for the <!-- Transcriber's note: original reads "the the" -->
clappers who did not care about the comforts
of a home.</p>

<p>Now of course a good house does not
<a name="png.201" id="png.201"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">162</span><span class="ns">
 </span>remain empty long, especially when there is no
rent to pay, and in a very short time the seven
bells all had tenants, and they were all the kind
of folk that no respectable Bell-people would
care to be acquainted with.</p>

<p>They had been turned out of other bells&mdash;cracked
bells and broken bells, the bells of
horses that had been lost in snowstorms or of
ships that had gone down at sea. They hated
work, and they were a glum, silent, disagreeable
people, but as far as they could be pleased
about anything they were pleased to live in
bells that were never rung, in houses where
there was nothing to do. They sat hunched up
under the black domes of their houses, dressed
in darkness and cobwebs, and their only
pleasure was idleness, their only feasts the
thick dusty silence that lies heavy in all belfries
where the bells never ring. They hardly ever
spoke even to each other, and in the whispers
that good Bell-people talk in among themselves,
and that no one can hear but the bat whose ear
for music is very fine and who has himself a
particularly high voice, and when they did
speak they quarrelled.</p>

<p>And when at last the bells <em>were</em> rung for the
birth of a Princess the wicked Bell-people were
furious. Of course they had to <em>ring</em>&mdash;a bell
can&#8217;t help that when the rope is pulled&mdash;but
<a name="png.202" id="png.202"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">163</span><span class="ns">
 </span>their voices were so ugly that people were quite
shocked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What poor taste our ancestors must have
had,&rsquo; they said, &lsquo;to think these were good bells!&rsquo;</p>

<p>(You remember the bells had not rung for
nearly two hundred years.)</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said the King to the Queen,
&lsquo;what odd ideas people had in the old days.
I always understood that these bells had
beautiful voices.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;They&#8217;re quite hideous,&rsquo; said the Queen.
And so they were. Now that night the lazy
Bell-folk came down out of the belfry full of
anger against the Princess whose birth had
disturbed their idleness. There is no anger
like that of a lazy person who is made to work
against his will.</p>

<p>And they crept out of the dark domes of
their houses and came down in their dust
dresses and cobweb cloaks, and crept up to the
palace where every one had gone to bed long
before, and stood round the mother-of-pearl
cradle where the baby princess lay asleep.
And they reached their seven dark right hands
out across the white satin coverlet, and the
oldest and hoarsest and laziest said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;She shall grow uglier every day, except
Sundays, and every Sunday she shall be seven
times prettier than the Sunday before.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.203" id="png.203"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">164</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Why not uglier every day, and a double
dose on Sunday?&rsquo; asked the youngest and
spitefullest of the wicked Bell-people.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because there&#8217;s no rule without an exception,&rsquo;
said the eldest and hoarsest and laziest,
&lsquo;and she&#8217;ll feel it all the more if she&#8217;s pretty
once a week. And,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;this shall go
on till she finds a bell that doesn&#8217;t ring, and
can&#8217;t ring, and never will ring, and wasn&#8217;t made
to ring.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why not for ever?&rsquo; asked the young and
spiteful.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nothing goes on for ever,&rsquo; said the eldest
Bell-person, &lsquo;not even ill-luck. And we have
to leave her a way out. It doesn&#8217;t matter. She&#8217;ll
never know what it is. Let alone finding it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then they went back to the belfry and
rearranged as well as they could the comfortable
web-and-owls&#8217; nest furniture of their
houses which had all been shaken up and
disarranged by that absurd ringing of bells
at the birth of a Princess that nobody could
really be pleased about.</p>

<p>When the Princess was two weeks old
the King said to the Queen:</p>

<p>&lsquo;My love&mdash;the Princess is not so handsome
as I thought she was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense, Henry,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;the
light&#8217;s not good, that&#8217;s all.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.204" id="png.204"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">165</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Next day&mdash;it was Sunday&mdash;the King pulled
back the lace curtains of the cradle and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;The light&#8217;s good enough now&mdash;and you
see <span class="nw">she&#8217;s&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>He stopped.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It <em>must</em> have been the light,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;she
looks all right to-day.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course she does, a precious,&rsquo; said the
Queen.</p>

<p>But on Monday morning His Majesty was
quite sure really that the Princess was rather
plain, for a Princess. And when Sunday
came, and the Princess had on her best robe
and the cap with the little white ribbons in
the frill, he rubbed his nose and said there
was no doubt dress did make a great deal
of difference. For the Princess was now as
pretty as a new daisy.</p>

<p>The Princess was several years old before
her mother could be got to see that it really
was better for the child to wear plain clothes
and a veil on week days. On Sundays, of
course she could wear her best frock and a
clean crown just like anybody else.</p>

<p>Of course nobody ever told the Princess
how ugly she was. She wore a veil on week-days,
and so did every one else in the palace,
and she was never allowed to look in the
glass except on Sundays, so that she had
<a name="png.205" id="png.205"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">166</span><span class="ns">
 </span>no idea that she was not as pretty all the
week as she was on the first day of it. She
grew up therefore quite contented. But the
parents were in despair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said King Henry, &lsquo;it&#8217;s high time
she was married. We ought to choose a king
to rule the realm&mdash;I have always looked
forward to her marrying at twenty-one&mdash;and to
our retiring on a modest competence to some
nice little place in the country where we could
have a few pigs.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;And a cow,&rsquo; said the Queen, wiping her
eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And a pony and trap,&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And hens,&rsquo; said the Queen, &lsquo;yes. And
now it can never, never be. Look at the
child! I just ask you! Look at her!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>No</em>,&rsquo; said the King firmly, &lsquo;I haven&#8217;t done
that since she was ten, except on Sundays.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Couldn&#8217;t we get a prince to agree to a
&ldquo;Sundays only&rdquo; marriage&mdash;not let him see her
during the week?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Such an unusual arrangement,&rsquo; said the
King, &lsquo;would involve very awkward explanations,
and I can&#8217;t think of any except the
true ones, which would be quite impossible
to give. You see, we should want a first-class
prince, and no really high-toned Highness
would take a wife on those terms.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.206" id="png.206"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">167</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;It&#8217;s a thoroughly comfortable kingdom,&rsquo;
said the Queen doubtfully. &lsquo;The young man
would be handsomely provided for for life.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I couldn&#8217;t marry Belinda to a time-server
or a place-worshipper,&rsquo; said the King decidedly.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Princess had taken the
matter into her own hands. She had fallen
in love.</p>

<p>You know, of course, that a handsome book
is sent out every year to all the kings who
have daughters to marry. It is rather like
the illustrated catalogues of Liberty&#8217;s or Peter
Robinson&#8217;s, only instead of illustrations showing
furniture or ladies&#8217; cloaks and dresses, the
pictures are all of princes who are of an
age to be married, and are looking out for
suitable wives. The book is called the &lsquo;Royal
Match Catalogue Illustrated,&rsquo;&mdash;and besides the
pictures of the princes it has little printed
bits about their incomes, accomplishments, <!-- comma missing from original -->
prospects, and tempers, and relations.</p>

<p>Now the Princess saw this book&mdash;which
is never shown to princesses, but only to
their parents&mdash;it was carelessly left lying on
the round table in the parlour. She looked
all through it, and she hated each prince
more than the one before till she came to
the very end, and on the last page of all,
<a name="png.207" id="png.207"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">168</span><span class="ns">
 </span>screwed away in a corner, was the picture of
a prince who was quite as good-looking as
a prince has any call to be.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I like <em>you</em>,&rsquo; said Belinda softly. Then she
read the little bit of print underneath.</p>

<p><i>Prince Bellamant, aged twenty-four. Wants
Princess who doesn&#8217;t object to a christening curse.
Nature of curse only revealed in the strictest
confidence. Good tempered. Comfortably off.
Quiet habits. No relations.</i></p>

<p>&lsquo;Poor dear,&rsquo; said the Princess. &lsquo;I wonder
what the curse is! I&#8217;m sure <em>I</em> shouldn&#8217;t mind!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The blue dusk of evening was deepening in
the garden outside. The Princess rang for the
lamp and went to draw the curtain. There
was a rustle and a faint high squeak&mdash;and
something black flopped on to the floor and
fluttered there.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh&mdash;it&#8217;s a bat,&rsquo; cried the Princess, as the
lamp came in. &lsquo;I don&#8217;t like bats.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Let me fetch a dust-pan and brush and
sweep the nasty thing away,&rsquo; said the parlourmaid.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Belinda, &lsquo;it&#8217;s hurt, poor dear,&rsquo;
and though she hated bats she picked it up.
It was horribly cold to touch, one wing dragged
loosely. &lsquo;You can go, Jane,&rsquo; said the Princess
to the parlourmaid.</p>

<p><!-- original has extraneous opening quote
-->Then she got a big velvet-covered box
<a name="png.208" id="png.208"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">169</span><span class="ns">
 </span>that had had chocolate in it, and put some
cotton wool in it and said to the Bat&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You poor dear, is that comfortable?&rsquo; and
the Bat said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite, thanks.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good gracious,&rsquo; said the Princess jumping.
&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t know bats could talk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Every one can talk,&rsquo; said the Bat, &lsquo;but not
every one can hear other people talking. You
have a fine ear as well as a fine heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Will your wing ever get well?&rsquo; asked the
Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; said the Bat. &lsquo;But let&#8217;s talk <!-- Transciber's note: original lacks closing quote -->
about you. Do you know why you wear a veil
every day except Sundays?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Doesn&#8217;t everybody?&rsquo; asked Belinda.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Only here in the palace,&rsquo; said the Bat,
&lsquo;that&#8217;s on your account.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why?&rsquo; asked the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Look in the glass and you&#8217;ll know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But it&#8217;s wicked to look in the glass except
on Sundays&mdash;and besides they&#8217;re all put away,&rsquo;
said the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I were you,&rsquo; said the Bat, &lsquo;I should go
up into the attic where the youngest kitchenmaid
sleeps. Feel between the thatch and the
wall just above her pillow, and you&#8217;ll find a little
round looking-glass. But come back here
before you look at it.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.209" id="png.209"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">170</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The Princess did exactly what the Bat told
her to do, and when she had come back into
the parlour and shut the door she looked in the
little round glass that the youngest kitchen-maid&#8217;s
sweetheart had given her. And when
she saw her ugly, ugly, ugly face&mdash;for you must
remember she had been growing uglier every
day since she was born&mdash;she screamed and then
she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s not me, it&#8217;s a horrid picture.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It <em>is</em> you, though,&rsquo; said the Bat firmly but
kindly; &lsquo;and now you see why you wear a veil all
the week&mdash;and only look in the glass on Sunday.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But why,&rsquo; asked the Princess in tears, &lsquo;why
don&#8217;t I look like that in the Sunday looking-glasses?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Because you aren&#8217;t like that on Sundays,&rsquo;
the Bat replied. &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; it went on, &lsquo;stop
crying. I didn&#8217;t tell you the dread secret of your
ugliness just to make you cry&mdash;but because I
know the way for you to be as pretty all the
week as you are on Sundays, and since you&#8217;ve
been so kind to me I&#8217;ll tell you. Sit down
close beside me, it fatigues me to speak loud.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess did, and listened through her
veil and her tears, while the Bat told her all
that I began this story by telling you.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My great-great-great-great-grandfather
heard the tale years ago,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;up in the
<a name="png.210" id="png.210"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">171</span><span class="ns">
 </span>dark, dusty, beautiful, comfortable, cobwebby
belfry, and I have heard scraps of it myself
when the evil Bell-people were quarrelling,
or talking in their sleep, lazy things!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s very good of you to tell me all this,&rsquo;
said Belinda, &lsquo;but what am I to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You must find the bell that doesn&#8217;t ring, and
can&#8217;t ring, and never will ring, and wasn&#8217;t made
to ring.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If I were a prince,&rsquo; said the Princess, &lsquo;I
could go out and seek my fortune.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Princesses have fortunes as well as princes,&rsquo;
said the Bat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But father and mother would never let
me go and look for mine.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Think!&rsquo; said the Bat, &lsquo;perhaps you&#8217;ll find
a way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Belinda thought and thought. And at
last she got the book that had the portraits of
eligible princes in it, and she wrote to the
prince who had the christening curse&mdash;and
this is what she said:</p>

<div class="blockq">
<p><br class="ns" />&lsquo;Princess Belinda of Carrillon-land is not
afraid of christening curses. If Prince Bellamant
would like to marry her he had better
apply to her Royal Father in the usual way.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i>P.S.</i>&mdash;I have seen your portrait.&rsquo;<br class="ns" /></p>
</div>

<p>When the Prince got this letter he was very
<a name="png.211" id="png.211"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">172</span><span class="ns">
 </span>pleased, and wrote at once for Princess
Belinda&#8217;s likeness. Of course they sent him a
picture of her Sunday face, which was the most
beautiful face in the world. As soon as he
saw it he knew that this was not only the most
beautiful face in the world, but the dearest, so
he wrote to her father by the next post&mdash;applying
for her hand in the usual way and
enclosing the most respectable references.
The King told the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;what do you say to this
young man?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And the Princess, of course, said, &lsquo;Yes,
please.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the wedding-day was fixed for the first
Sunday in June.</p>

<p>But when the Prince arrived with all his
glorious following of courtiers and men-at-arms,
with two pink peacocks and a crown-case full of
diamonds for his bride, he absolutely refused to
be married on a Sunday. Nor would he give
any reason for his refusal. And then the King
lost his temper and broke off the match, and
the Prince went away.</p>

<p>But he did not go very far. That night he
bribed a page-boy to show him which was the
Princess&#8217;s room, and he climbed up by the
jasmine through the dark rose-scented night,
and tapped at the window.</p>

<p><a name="png.212" id="png.212"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">173</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Who&#8217;s dhere?&rsquo; said the Princess inside in
the dark.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Me,&rsquo; said the Prince in the dark outside.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thed id wasnd&#8217;t true?&rsquo; said the Princess.
&lsquo;They toad be you&#8217;d ridded away.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What a cold you&#8217;ve got, my Princess,&rsquo; said
the Prince hanging on by the jasmine boughs.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s not a cold,&rsquo; sniffed the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then &hellip; oh you dear &hellip; were you
crying because you thought I&#8217;d gone?&rsquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I suppose so,&rsquo; said she.</p>

<p>He said, &lsquo;You dear!&rsquo; again, and kissed her
hands.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Why</em> wouldn&#8217;t you be married on a
Sunday?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s the curse, dearest,&rsquo; he explained, &lsquo;I
couldn&#8217;t tell any one but you. The fact is
Malevola wasn&#8217;t asked to my christening so
she doomed me to be &hellip; well, she said
&ldquo;moderately good-looking all the week, and
too ugly for words on Sundays.&rdquo; So you see!
You <em>will</em> be married on a week-day, won&#8217;t
you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I can&#8217;t,&rsquo; said the Princess, &lsquo;because
I&#8217;ve got a curse too&mdash;only I&#8217;m ugly all the
week and pretty on Sundays.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How extremely tiresome,&rsquo; said the Prince,
&lsquo;but can&#8217;t you be cured?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.213" id="png.213"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">174</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh yes,&rsquo; said the Princess, and told him
how. &lsquo;And you,&rsquo; she asked, &lsquo;is yours quite
incurable?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; he answered, &lsquo;I&#8217;ve only got to
stay under water for five minutes and the spell
will be broken. But you see, beloved, the
difficulty is that I can&#8217;t do it. I&#8217;ve practised
regularly, from a boy, in the sea, and in the
swimming bath, and even in my wash-hand
basin&mdash;hours at a time I&#8217;ve practised&mdash;but I
never can keep under more than two minutes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dear,&rsquo; said the Princess, &lsquo;this is
dreadful.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It is rather trying,&rsquo; the Prince answered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re sure you like me,&rsquo; she asked
suddenly, &lsquo;now you know that I&#8217;m only pretty
once a week?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;d die for you,&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I&#8217;ll tell you what. Send all your
courtiers away, and take a situation as under-gardener
here&mdash;I know we want one. And
then every night I&#8217;ll climb down the jasmine
and we&#8217;ll go out together and seek our fortune.
I&#8217;m sure we shall find it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And they did go out. The very next night,
and the next, and the next, and the next, and
the next, and the next. And they did not find
their fortunes, but they got fonder and fonder
of each other. They could not see each other&#8217;s
<a name="png.214" id="png.214"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">175</span><span class="ns">
 </span>faces, but they held hands as they went along
through the dark.</p>

<p>And on the seventh night, as they passed by
a house that showed chinks of light through its
shutters, they heard a bell being rung outside
for supper, a bell with a very loud and beautiful
voice. But instead of saying&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Supper&#8217;s ready,&rsquo; as any one would have
expected, the bell was saying&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width30">
<div class="stanza"><small>Ding dong dell!</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small><em>I</em> could tell</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Where you ought to go</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>To break the spell.</small></div>
</div>

<p>Then some one left off ringing the bell, so
of course it couldn&#8217;t say any more. So the two
went on. A little way down the road a cow-bell
tinkled behind the wet hedge of the lane.
And it said&mdash;not, &lsquo;Here I am, quite safe,&rsquo; as a
cow-bell should, but&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width30">
<div class="stanza"><small>Ding dong dell</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>All will be well</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>If you&hellip;</small></div>
</div>

<p>Then the cow stopped walking and began to
eat, so the bell couldn&#8217;t say any more. The
Prince and Princess went on, and you will not
be surprised to hear that they heard the voices
of five more bells that night. The next was a
school-bell. The schoolmaster&#8217;s little boy
<a name="png.215" id="png.215"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">176</span><span class="ns">
 </span>thought it would be fun to ring it very late
at night&mdash;but his father came and caught him
before the bell could say any more than&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem width30">
<div class="stanza"><small>Ding a dong dell</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>You can break up the spell</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>By taking&hellip;</small></div>
</div>

<p class="cont">So that was no good.</p>

<p>Then there were the three bells that were
the sign over the door of an inn where people
were happily dancing to a fiddle, because there
was a wedding. These bells said:</p>

<div class="poem width30">
<div class="stanza"><small>We are the</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Merry three</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Bells, bells, bells.</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>You are two</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>To undo</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Spells, spells, spells&hellip;</small></div>
</div>

<p>Then the wind who was swinging the bells
suddenly thought of an appointment he had
made with a pine forest, to get up an entertaining
imitation of sea-waves for the benefit of
the forest nymphs who had never been to the
seaside, and he went off&mdash;so, of course, the
bells couldn&#8217;t ring any more, and the Prince
and Princess went on down the dark road.</p>

<p>There was a cottage and the Princess pulled
her veil closely over her face, for yellow light
streamed from its open door&mdash;and it was a
Wednesday.</p>

<p><a name="png.216" id="png.216"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">177</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Inside a little boy was sitting on the floor&mdash;quite
a little boy&mdash;he ought to have been in
bed long before, and I don&#8217;t know why he
wasn&#8217;t. And he was ringing a little tinkling
bell that had dropped off a sleigh.</p>

<p>And this little bell said:</p>

<div class="poem width60">
<div class="stanza"><small>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, I&#8217;m a little sleigh-bell,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>But I know what I know, and I&#8217;ll tell, tell, tell.</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Find the Enchanter of the Ringing Well,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>He will show you how to break the spell, spell, spell.</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle, I&#8217;m a little sleigh-bell,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>But I know what I know&hellip;.</small></div>
</div>

<p class="cont">And so on, over and over, again and again,
because the little boy was quite contented to
go on shaking his sleigh-bell for ever and ever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So now we know,&rsquo; said the Prince, &lsquo;isn&#8217;t
that glorious?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, very, but where&#8217;s the Enchanter of
the Ringing Well?&rsquo; said the Princess doubtfully.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, I&#8217;ve got <em>his</em> address in my pocket-book,&rsquo;
said the Prince. &lsquo;He&#8217;s my god-father.
He was one of the references I gave your
father.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the next night the Prince brought a
horse to the garden, and he and the Princess
mounted, and rode, and rode, and rode, and in
the grey dawn they came to Wonderwood, and
<a name="png.217" id="png.217"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">178</span><span class="ns">
 </span>in the very middle of that the Magician&#8217;s Palace
stands.</p>

<p>The Princess did not like to call on a perfect
stranger so very early in the morning, so they
decided to wait a little and look about them.</p>

<p>The castle was very beautiful, decorated
with a conventional design of bells and bell
ropes, carved in white stone.</p>

<p>Luxuriant plants of American bell-vine
covered the drawbridge and portcullis. On a
green lawn in front of the castle was a well,
with a curious bell-shaped covering suspended
over it. The lovers leaned over the mossy
fern-grown wall of the well, and, looking down,
they could see that the narrowness of the well
only lasted for a few feet, and below that it
spread into a cavern where water lay in a
big pool.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What cheer?&rsquo; said a pleasant voice behind
them. It was the Enchanter, an early riser,
like Darwin was, and all other great scientific
men.</p>

<p>They told him what cheer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But,&rsquo; Prince Bellamant ended, &lsquo;it&#8217;s really
no use. I can&#8217;t keep under water more than
two minutes however much I try. And my
precious Belinda&#8217;s not likely to find any silly
old bell that doesn&#8217;t ring, and can&#8217;t ring, and
never will ring, and was never made to ring.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.218" id="png.218"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">179</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Ho, ho,&rsquo; laughed the Enchanter with the
soft full laughter of old age. &lsquo;You&#8217;ve come to
the right shop. Who told you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;The bells,&rsquo; said Belinda.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah, yes.&rsquo; The old man frowned kindly
upon them. &lsquo;You must be very fond of each
other?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We are,&rsquo; said the two together.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; the Enchanter answered, &lsquo;because
only true lovers can hear the true speech of
the bells, and then only when they&#8217;re together.
Well, there&#8217;s the bell!&rsquo;</p>

<p>He pointed to the covering of the well, went
forward, and touched some lever or spring. The
covering swung out from above the well, and
hung over the grass grey with the dew of dawn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>That?</em>&rsquo; said Bellamant.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That,&rsquo; said his god-father. &lsquo;It doesn&#8217;t
ring, and it can&#8217;t ring, and it never will ring, and
it was never made to ring. Get into it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Eh?&rsquo; said Bellamant forgetting his manners.</p>

<p>The old man took a hand of each and led
them under the bell.</p>

<p>They looked up. It had windows of thick
glass, and high seats about four feet from its
edge, running all round inside.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take your seats,&rsquo; said the Enchanter.</p>

<p>Bellamant lifted his Princess to the bench
and leaped up beside her.</p>

<p><a name="png.219" id="png.219"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">180</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the old man, &lsquo;sit still, hold each
other&#8217;s hands, and for your lives don&#8217;t move.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He went away, and next moment they felt
the bell swing in the air. It swung round till
once more it was over the well, and then it
went down, down, down.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m not afraid, with you,&rsquo; said Belinda,
because she was, dreadfully.</p>

<p>Down went the bell. The glass windows
leaped into light, looking through them the
two could see blurred glories of lamps in the
side of the cave, magic lamps, or perhaps merely
electric, which, curiously enough have ceased
to seem magic to us nowadays. Then with a
plop the lower edge of the bell met the water,
the water rose inside it, a little, then not any
more. And the bell went down, down, and
above their heads the green water lapped
against the windows of the bell.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re under water&mdash;if we stay five minutes,&rsquo;
Belinda whispered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, dear,&rsquo; said Bellamant, and pulled out
his ruby-studded chronometer.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s five minutes for you, but oh!&rsquo; cried
Belinda, &lsquo;it&#8217;s <em>now</em> for me. For I&#8217;ve found the
bell that doesn&#8217;t ring, and can&#8217;t ring, and never
will ring, and wasn&#8217;t made to ring. Oh
Bellamant dearest, it&#8217;s Thursday. <em>Have</em> I got
my Sunday face?&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.220" id="png.220"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">181</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She tore away her veil, and his eyes, fixed
upon her face, could not leave it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dream of all the world&#8217;s delight,&rsquo; he
murmured, &lsquo;how beautiful you are.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Neither spoke again till a sudden little
shock told them that the bell was moving up
again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; said Bellamant, &lsquo;it&#8217;s not five
minutes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But when they looked at the ruby-studded
chronometer, it was nearly three-quarters of
an hour. But then, of course, the well was
enchanted!</p>

<p>&lsquo;Magic? Nonsense,&rsquo; said the old man when
they hung about him with thanks and pretty
words. &lsquo;It&#8217;s only a diving-bell. My own
invention.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>So they went home and were married, and
the Princess did not wear a veil at the wedding.
She said she had had enough veils to last her
time.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>And a year and a day after that a little
daughter was born to them.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now sweetheart,&rsquo; said King Bellamant&mdash;he
was king now because the old king and
queen had retired from the business, and were
keeping pigs and hens in the country as they
<a name="png.221" id="png.221"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">182</span><span class="ns">
 </span>had always planned to do&mdash;&lsquo;dear sweetheart
and life&#8217;s love, I am going to ring the bells
with my own hands, to show how glad I am
for you, and for the child, and for our good life
together.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went out. It was very dark, because
the baby princess had chosen to be born at
midnight.</p>

<p>The King went out to the belfry, that stood
in the great, bare, quiet, moonlit square, and
he opened the door. The furry-pussy bell-ropes,
like huge caterpillars, hung on the first
loft. The King began to climb the curly-wurly
stone stair. And as he went up he heard
a noise, the strangest noises, stamping and
rustling and deep breathings.</p>

<p>He stood still in the ringers&#8217; loft where the
pussy-furry caterpillary bell-robes hung, and
from the belfry above he heard the noise of
strong fighting, and mixed with it the sound
of voices angry and desperate, but with a noble
note that thrilled the soul of the hearer like
the sound of the trumpet in battle. And the
voices cried:</p>

<div class="poem width60">
<div class="stanza"><small>Down, down&mdash;away, away,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>When good has come ill may not stay,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Out, out, into the night,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>The belfry bells are ours by right!</small></div>
</div>

<p><a name="png.222" id="png.222"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">183</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And the words broke and joined again, like
water when it flows against the piers of a
bridge. &lsquo;Down, <span class="nw">down&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</span> &lsquo;Ill may not
<span class="nw">stay&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</span> &lsquo;Good has <span class="nw">come&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</span> &lsquo;Away,
<span class="nw">away&mdash;&mdash;.&rsquo;</span> And the joining came like the
sound of the river that flows free again.</p>

<div class="poem width60">
<div class="stanza"><small>Out, out, into the night,</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>The belfry bells are ours by right!</small></div>
</div>

<p>And then, as King Bellamant stood there,
thrilled and yet, as it were, turned to stone, by
the magic of this conflict that raged above him,
there came a sweeping rush down the belfry
ladder. The lantern he carried showed him a
rout of little, dark, evil people, clothed in dust
and cobwebs, that scurried down the wooden
steps gnashing their teeth and growling in the
bitterness of a deserved defeat. They passed
and there was silence. Then the King flew
from rope to rope pulling lustily, and from
above, the bells answered in their own clear
beautiful voices&mdash;because the good Bell-folk
had driven out the usurpers and had come to
their own again.</p>

<div class="poem width60">
<div class="stanza"><small>Ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring-a-ring! Ring, bell!</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>A little baby comes on earth to dwell. Ring, bell!</small></div>
<div class="stanza"><small>Sound, bell! Sound! Swell!</small></div>

<div class="stanza"><small>Ring, bell! Joy, bell! Love, bell! Ring!</small></div>
</div>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>&lsquo;But I don&#8217;t see,&rsquo; said King Bellamant,
when he had told Queen Belinda all about it,
&lsquo;how it was that I came to hear them. The
Enchanter of the Ringing Well said that only
lovers could hear what the bells had to say,
and then only when they were together.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You silly dear boy,&rsquo; said Queen Belinda,
cuddling the baby princess close under her
chin, &lsquo;we <em>are</em> lovers, aren&#8217;t we? And you
don&#8217;t suppose I wasn&#8217;t with you when you
went to ring the bells for our baby&mdash;my heart
and soul anyway&mdash;all of me that matters!&rsquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the King, &lsquo;of course you were.
That accounts!&rsquo;</p>

 /></span><b>VIII</b><br
 />JUSTNOWLAND</h2>


<p>&lsquo;<span class="smcap">Auntie</span>! No, no, no! I will be good. Oh,
I will!&rsquo; The little weak voice came from the
other side of the locked attic door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You should have thought of that before,&rsquo;
said the strong, sharp voice outside.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t mean to be naughty. I didn&#8217;t,
truly.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s not what you mean, miss, it&#8217;s what you
do. I&#8217;ll teach you not to mean, my lady.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The bitter irony of the last words dried the
child&#8217;s tears. &lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; she screamed,
&lsquo;I won&#8217;t be good; I won&#8217;t try to be good. I
thought you&#8217;d like your nasty old garden
weeded. I only did it to please you. How
was I to know it was turnips? It looked just
like weeds.&rsquo; Then came a pause, then another
shriek. &lsquo;Oh, Auntie, don&#8217;t! Oh, let me out&mdash;let
me out!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll not let you out till I&#8217;ve broken your
spirit, my girl; you may rely on that.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.225" id="png.225"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">186</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The sharp voice stopped abruptly on a high
note; determined feet in strong boots sounded
on the stairs&mdash;fainter, fainter; a door slammed
below with a dreadful definiteness, and Elsie
was left alone, to wonder how soon her spirit
would break&mdash;for at no less a price, it appeared,
could freedom be bought.</p>

<p>The outlook seemed hopeless. The martyrs
and heroines, with whom Elsie usually identified
herself, <em>their</em> spirit had never been broken;
not chains nor the rack nor the fiery stake
itself had even weakened them. Imprisonment
in an attic would to them have been luxury
compared with the boiling oil and the smoking
faggots and all the intimate cruelties of
mysterious instruments of steel and leather,
in cold dungeons, lit only by the dull flare of
torches and the bright, watchful eyes of
inquisitors.</p>

<p>A month in the house of &lsquo;Auntie&rsquo; self-styled,
and really only an unrelated Mrs.
Staines, paid to take care of the child, had
held but one interest&mdash;Foxe&#8217;s Book of Martyrs.
It was a horrible book&mdash;the thick oleographs,
their guarding sheets of tissue paper sticking to
the prints like bandages to a wound&hellip;. Elsie
knew all about wounds: she had had one herself.
Only a scalded hand, it is true, but a
wound is a wound, all the world over. It was
<a name="png.226" id="png.226"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">187</span><span class="ns">
 </span>a book that made you afraid to go to bed; but
it was a book you could not help reading.
And now it seemed as though it might at last
help, and not merely sicken and terrify. But
the help was frail, and broke almost instantly
on the thought&mdash;&lsquo;<em>They</em> were brave because
they were good: how can I be brave when
there&#8217;s nothing to be brave about except me
not knowing the difference between turnips and
weeds?&rsquo;</p>

<p>She sank down, a huddled black bunch on
the bare attic floor, and called wildly to some
one who could not answer her. Her frock was
black because the one who always used to
answer could not answer any more. And her
father was in India, where you cannot answer,
or even hear, your little girl, however much
she cries in England.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I won&#8217;t cry,&rsquo; said Elsie, sobbing as violently
as ever. &lsquo;I can be brave, even if I&#8217;m not a
saint but only a turnip-mistaker. I&#8217;ll be a
Bastille prisoner, and tame a mouse!&rsquo; She
dried her eyes, though the bosom of the black
frock still heaved like the sea after a storm,
and looked about for a mouse to tame. One
could not begin too soon. But unfortunately
there seemed to be no mouse at liberty just
then. There were mouse-holes right enough,
all round the wainscot, and in the broad, time-worn
<a name="png.227" id="png.227"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">188</span><span class="ns">
 </span>boards of the old floor. But never a
mouse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mouse, mouse!&rsquo; Elsie called softly. &lsquo;Mousie,
mousie, come and be tamed!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Not a mouse replied.</p>

<p>The attic was perfectly empty and dreadfully
clean. The other attic, Elsie knew, had
lots of interesting things in it&mdash;old furniture
and saddles, and sacks of seed potatoes,&mdash;but
in this attic nothing. Not so much as a bit of
string on the floor that one could make knots
in, or twist round one&#8217;s finger till it made the
red ridges that are so interesting to look at
afterwards; not even a piece of paper in the
draughty, cold fireplace that one could make
paper boats of, or prick letters in with a pin or
the tag of one&#8217;s shoe-laces.</p>

<p>As she stooped to see whether under the
grate some old match-box or bit of twig might
have escaped the broom, she saw suddenly
what she had wanted most&mdash;a mouse. It was
lying on its side. She put out her hand very
slowly and gently, and whispered in her softest
tones, &lsquo;Wake up, Mousie, wake up, and
come and be tamed.&rsquo; But the mouse never
moved. And when she took it in her hand
it was cold.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she moaned, &lsquo;you&#8217;re dead, and now I
can never tame you&rsquo;; and she sat on the cold
<a name="png.228" id="png.228"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">189</span><span class="ns">
 </span>hearth and cried again, with the dead mouse in
her lap.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t cry,&rsquo; said somebody. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll find you
something to tame&mdash;if you really want it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elsie started and saw the head of a black
bird peering at her through the square opening
that leads to the chimney. The edges of him
looked ragged and rainbow-coloured, but that
was because she saw him through tears. To a
tearless eye he was black and very smooth and
sleek.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; she said, and nothing more.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; said the bird politely. &lsquo;You are
surprised to hear me speak, but your surprise
will be, of course, much less when I tell you
that I am really a Prime Minister condemned
by an Enchanter to wear the form of a crow
till &hellip; till I can get rid of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Elsie.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, indeed,&rsquo; said the Crow, and suddenly
grew smaller till he could come comfortably
through the square opening. He did this,
perched on the top bar, and hopped to the
floor. And there he got bigger and bigger,
and bigger and bigger and bigger. Elsie had
scrambled to her feet, and then a black little girl
of eight and of the usual size stood face to face
with a crow as big as a man, and no doubt
as old. She found words then.</p>

<p><a name="png.229" id="png.229"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">190</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh, don&#8217;t!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;Don&#8217;t get any
bigger. I can&#8217;t bear it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>I</em> can&#8217;t <em>do</em> it,&rsquo; said the Crow kindly, &lsquo;so
that&#8217;s all right. I thought you&#8217;d better get used
to seeing rather large crows before I take you
to Crownowland. We are all life-size there.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But a crow&#8217;s life-size isn&#8217;t a man&#8217;s life-size,&rsquo;
Elsie managed to say.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, it is&mdash;when it&#8217;s an enchanted
Crow,&rsquo; the bird replied. &lsquo;That makes all the
difference. Now you were saying you wanted
to tame something. If you&#8217;ll come with me to
Crownowland I&#8217;ll show you something worth
taming.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is Crow-what&#8217;s-its-name a nice place?&rsquo; <!-- Transcriber's note: endquote invisible in original -->
Elsie asked cautiously. She was, somehow,
not so very frightened now.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very,&rsquo; said the Crow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then perhaps I shall like it so much I
sha&#8217;n&#8217;t want to be taming things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh yes, you will, when you know how
much depends on it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I shouldn&#8217;t like,&rsquo; said Elsie, &lsquo;to go up
the chimney. This isn&#8217;t my best frock, of
course, but still&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite so,&rsquo; said the Crow. &lsquo;I only came
that way for fun, and because I can fly. You
shall go in by the chief gate of the kingdom,
like a lady. Do come.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.230" id="png.230"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">191</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But Elsie still hesitated. &lsquo;What sort of
thing is it you want me to tame?&rsquo; she said
doubtfully.</p>

<p>The enormous crow hesitated. &lsquo;A&mdash;a sort
of lizard,&rsquo; it said at last. &lsquo;And if you can only
tame it so that it will do what you tell it to,
you&#8217;ll save the whole kingdom, and we&#8217;ll put
up a statue to you; but not in the People&#8217;s
Park, unless they wish it,&rsquo; the bird added
mysteriously.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I should like to save a kingdom,&rsquo; said Elsie,
&lsquo;and I like lizards. I&#8217;ve seen lots of them in
India.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then you&#8217;ll come?&rsquo; said the Crow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes. But how do we go?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There are only two doors out of this world
into another,&rsquo; said the Crow. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll take you
through the nearest. Allow me!&rsquo; It put its
wing round her so that her face nestled against
the black softness of the under-wing feathers.
It was warm and dark and sleepy there, and
very comfortable. For a moment she seemed
to swim easily in a soft sea of dreams. Then,
with a little shock, she found herself standing
on a marble terrace, looking out over a city far
more beautiful and wonderful than she had ever
seen or imagined. The great man-sized Crow
was by her side.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now,&rsquo; it said, pointing with the longest of
<a name="png.231" id="png.231"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">192</span><span class="ns">
 </span>its long black wing-feathers, &lsquo;you see this
beautiful city?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Elsie, &lsquo;of course I do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well &hellip; I hardly like to tell you the
story,&rsquo; said the Crow, &lsquo;but it&#8217;s a long time ago,
and I hope you won&#8217;t think the worse of us&mdash;because
we&#8217;re really very sorry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you&#8217;re really sorry,&rsquo; said Elsie primly,
&lsquo;of course it&#8217;s all right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Unfortunately it isn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said the Crow.
&lsquo;You see the great square down there?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elsie looked down on a square of green
trees, broken a little towards the middle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, that&#8217;s where the &hellip; where <em>it</em> is&mdash;what
you&#8217;ve got to tame, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But what did you do that was wrong?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We were unkind,&rsquo; said the Crow slowly,
&lsquo;and unjust, and ungenerous. We had servants
and workpeople doing everything for us; we had
nothing to do <em>but</em> be kind. And we weren&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said Elsie feebly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We had several warnings,&rsquo; said the Crow.
&lsquo;There was an old parchment, and it said just
how you ought to behave and all that. But
we didn&#8217;t care what it said. I was Court
Magician as well as Prime Minister, and I
ought to have known better, but I didn&#8217;t. We
all wore frock-coats and high hats then,&rsquo; he
added sadly.</p>

<p><a name="png.232" id="png.232"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">193</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said Elsie, her eyes wandering from
one beautiful building to another of the many
that nestled among the trees of the city.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And the old parchment said that if we
didn&#8217;t behave well our bodies would grow like
our souls. But we didn&#8217;t think so. And then
all in a minute they <em>did</em>&mdash;and we were crows,
and our bodies were as black as our souls.
Our souls are quite white now,&rsquo; it added
reassuringly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But what was <em>the</em> dreadful thing you&#8217;d
done?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We&#8217;d been unkind to the people who
worked for us&mdash;not given them enough food or
clothes or fire, and at last we took away even
their play. There was a big park that the
people played in, and we built a wall round it
and took it for ourselves, and the King was
going to set a statue of himself up in the middle.
And then before we could begin to enjoy it we
were turned into big black crows; and the
working people into big white pigeons&mdash;and
<em>they</em> can go where they like, but we have to
stay here till we&#8217;ve tamed the&hellip;. We never
can go into the park, until we&#8217;ve settled the
thing that guards it. And that thing&#8217;s a big
big lizard&mdash;in fact &hellip; it&#8217;s a <em>dragon</em>!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Oh!</em>&rsquo; cried Elsie; but she was not as
frightened as the Crow seemed to expect.
<a name="png.233" id="png.233"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">194</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Because every now and then she had felt sure
that she was really safe in her own bed, and
that this was a dream. It was not a dream, but
the belief that it was made her very brave,
and she felt quite sure that she could settle
a dragon, if necessary&mdash;a dream dragon, that
is. And the rest of the time she thought
about Foxe&#8217;s Book of Martyrs and what a
heroine she now had the chance to be.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You want me to kill it?&rsquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh no! To tame it,&rsquo; said the Crow.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We&#8217;ve tried all sorts of means&mdash;long whips,
like people tame horses with, and red-hot bars,
such as lion-tamers use&mdash;and it&#8217;s all been perfectly
useless; and there the dragon lives, and
will live till some one can tame him and get
him to follow them like a tame fawn, and eat
out of their hand.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What does the dragon <em>like</em> to eat?&rsquo; Elsie
asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Crows</em>,&rsquo; replied the other in an uncomfortable
whisper. &lsquo;At least <em>I&#8217;ve</em> never known it
eat anything else!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Am I to try to tame it <em>now</em>?&rsquo; Elsie asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh dear no,&rsquo; said the Crow. &lsquo;We&#8217;ll have
a banquet in your honour, and you shall have
tea with the Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How do you know who is a princess and
who&#8217;s not, if you&#8217;re all crows?&rsquo; Elsie cried.</p>

<p><a name="png.234" id="png.234"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">195</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;How do you know one human being from
another?&rsquo; the Crow replied. &lsquo;Besides &hellip;
Come on to the Palace.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It led her along the terrace, and down some
marble steps to a small arched door. &lsquo;The
tradesmen&#8217;s entrance,&rsquo; it explained. &lsquo;Excuse
it&mdash;the courtiers are crowding in by the front
door.&rsquo; Then through long corridors and passages
they went, and at last into the throne-room.
Many crows stood about in respectful
attitudes. On the golden throne, leaning a
gloomy head upon the first joint of his right
wing, the Sovereign of Crownowland was
musing dejectedly. A little girl of about
Elsie&#8217;s age sat on the steps of the throne nursing
a handsome doll.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who is the little girl?&rsquo; Elsie asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Curtsey!</em> That&#8217;s the Princess,&rsquo; the Prime
Minister Crow whispered; and Elsie made the
best curtsey she could think of in such a hurry.
&lsquo;She wasn&#8217;t wicked enough to be turned into a
crow, or poor enough to be turned into a pigeon,
so she remains a dear little girl, just as she
always was.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess dropped her doll and ran down
the steps of the throne to meet Elsie.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You dear!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;You&#8217;ve come to
play with me, haven&#8217;t you? All the little girls
I used to play with have turned into crows, and
<a name="png.235" id="png.235"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">196</span><span class="ns">
 </span>their beaks are <em>so</em> awkward at doll&#8217;s tea-parties,
and wings are no good to nurse dollies with.
Let&#8217;s have a doll&#8217;s tea-party <em>now</em>, shall we?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;May we?&rsquo; Elsie looked at the Crow King,
who nodded his head hopelessly. So, hand in
hand, they went.</p>

<p>I wonder whether you have ever had the
run of a perfectly beautiful palace and a nursery
absolutely crammed with all the toys you ever
had or wanted to have: dolls&#8217; houses, dolls&#8217;
china tea-sets, rocking-horses, bricks, nine-pins,
paint-boxes, conjuring tricks, pewter dinner-services,
and any number of dolls&mdash;all most
agreeable and distinguished. If you have, you
may perhaps be able faintly to imagine Elsie&#8217;s
happiness. And better than all the toys was
the Princess Perdona&mdash;so gentle and kind and
jolly, full of ideas for games, and surrounded by
the means for playing them. Think of it, after
that bare attic, with not even a bit of string to
play with, and no company but the poor little
dead mouse!</p>

<p>There is no room in this story to tell you
of all the games they had. I can only say
that the time went by so quickly that they
never noticed it going, and were amazed when
the Crown nursemaid brought in the royal
tea-tray. Tea was a beautiful meal&mdash;with pink
iced cake in it.</p>

<p><a name="png.236" id="png.236"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">197</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Now, all the time that these glorious games
had been going on, and this magnificent tea,
the wisest crows of Crownowland had been
holding a council. They had decided that
there was no time like the present, and that
Elsie had better try to tame the dragon soon
as late. &lsquo;But,&rsquo; the King said, &lsquo;she mustn&#8217;t
run any risks. A guard of fifty stalwart crows
must go with her, and if the dragon shows the
least temper, fifty crows must throw themselves
between her and danger, even if it cost fifty-one
crow-lives. For I myself will lead that
band. Who will volunteer?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Volunteers, to the number of some thousands,
instantly stepped forward, and the Field
Marshal selected fifty of the strongest crows.</p>

<p>And then, in the pleasant pinkness of the
sunset, Elsie was led out on to the palace
steps, where the King made a speech and said
what a heroine she was, and how like Joan of
Arc. And the crows who had gathered from
all parts of the town cheered madly. Did you
ever hear crows cheering? It is a wonderful
sound.</p>

<p>Then Elsie got into a magnificent gilt coach,
drawn by eight white horses, with a crow at
the head of each horse. The Princess sat
with her on the blue velvet cushions and held
her hand.</p>

<p><a name="png.237" id="png.237"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">198</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I <em>know</em> you&#8217;ll do it,&rsquo; said she; &lsquo;you&#8217;re so
brave and clever, Elsie!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And Elsie felt braver than before, although
now it did not seem so like a dream. But she
thought of the martyrs, and held Perdona&#8217;s
hand very tight.</p>

<p>At the gates of the green park the Princess
kissed and hugged her new friend&mdash;her state
crown, which she had put on in honour of the
occasion, got pushed quite on one side in the
warmth of her embrace&mdash;and Elsie stepped
out of the carriage. There was a great crowd
of crows round the park gates, and every one
cheered and shouted &lsquo;Speech, speech!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Elsie got as far as &lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen&mdash;Crows,
I mean,&rsquo; and then she could not
think of anything more, so she simply added,
&lsquo;Please, I&#8217;m ready.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I wish you could have heard those crows
cheer.</p>

<p>But Elsie wouldn&#8217;t have the escort.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s very kind,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but the dragon
only eats crows, and I&#8217;m not a crow, thank
goodness&mdash;I mean I&#8217;m not a crow&mdash;and if
I&#8217;ve got to be brave I&#8217;d like to <em>be</em> brave, and
none of you to get eaten. If only some one
will come with me to show me the way and
then run back as hard as he can when we get
near the dragon. <em>Please!</em>&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.238" id="png.238"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">199</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;If only one goes <em>I</em> shall be the one,&rsquo; said
the King. And he and Elsie went through
the great gates side by side. She held the
end of his wing, which was the nearest they
could get to hand in hand.</p>

<p>The crowd outside waited in breathless
silence. Elsie and the King went on through
the winding paths of the People&#8217;s Park. And
by the winding paths they came at last to the
Dragon. He lay very peacefully on a great
stone slab, his enormous bat-like wings spread
out on the grass and his goldy-green scales
glittering in the pretty pink sunset light.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go back!&rsquo; said Elsie.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the King.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you don&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Elsie, &lsquo;<em>I</em> won&#8217;t go <em>on</em>.
Seeing a crow might rouse him to fury, or
give him an appetite, or something. Do&mdash;do
go!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went, but not far. He hid behind a
tree, and from its shelter he watched.</p>

<p>Elsie drew a long breath. Her heart was
thumping under the black frock. &lsquo;Suppose,&rsquo;
she thought, &lsquo;he takes me for a crow!&rsquo; But
she thought how yellow her hair was, and
decided that the dragon would be certain to
notice that.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quick march!&rsquo; she said to herself, &lsquo;remember
Joan of Arc,&rsquo; and walked right up to
<a name="png.239" id="png.239"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">200</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the dragon. It never moved, but watched her
suspiciously out of its bright green eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dragon dear!&rsquo; she said in her clear little
voice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Eh?</em>&rsquo; said the dragon, in tones of extreme
astonishment.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dragon dear,&rsquo; she repeated, &lsquo;do you like
sugar?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Yes</em>,&rsquo; said the dragon.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, I&#8217;ve brought you some. You won&#8217;t
hurt me if I bring it to you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The dragon violently shook its vast head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s not much,&rsquo; said Elsie, &lsquo;but I saved it
at tea-time. Four lumps. Two for each of
my mugs of milk.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She laid the sugar on the stone slab by the
dragon&#8217;s paw.</p>

<p>It turned its head towards the sugar. The
pinky sunset light fell on its face, and Elsie
saw that it was weeping! Great fat tears as
big as prize pears were coursing down its
wrinkled cheeks.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, don&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Elsie, &lsquo;<em>don&#8217;t</em> cry! Poor
dragon, what&#8217;s the matter?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; sobbed the dragon, &lsquo;I&#8217;m only so glad
you&#8217;ve come. I&mdash;I&#8217;ve been so lonely. No
one to love me. You <em>do</em> love me, don&#8217;t you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I&#8217;m sure I shall when I know you
better,&rsquo; said Elsie kindly.</p>

<p><a name="png.240" id="png.240"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">201</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Give me a kiss, dear,&rsquo; said the dragon,
sniffing.</p>

<p>It is no joke to kiss a dragon. But Elsie
did it&mdash;somewhere on the hard green wrinkles
of its forehead.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, <em>thank</em> you,&rsquo; said the dragon, brushing
away its tears with the tip of its tail. &lsquo;That
breaks the charm. I can move now. And
I&#8217;ve got back all my lost wisdom. Come along&mdash;I
<em>do</em> want my tea!&rsquo;</p>

<p>So, to the waiting crowd at the gate came
Elsie and the dragon side by side. And at
sight of the dragon, tamed, a great shout went
up from the crowd; and at that shout each
one in the crowd turned quickly to the next
one&mdash;for it was the shout of men, and not of
crows. Because at the first sight of the dragon,
tamed, they had left off being crows for ever
and ever, and once again were men.</p>

<p>The King came running through the gates,
his royal robes held high, so that he shouldn&#8217;t
trip over them, and he too was no longer a
crow, but a man.</p>

<p>And what did Elsie feel after being so
brave? Well, she felt that she would like to
cry, and also to laugh, and she felt that she
loved not only the dragon, but every man,
woman, and child in the whole world&mdash;even
Mrs. Staines.</p>

<p><a name="png.241" id="png.241"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">202</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>She rode back to the Palace on the dragon&#8217;s
back.</p>

<p>And as they went the crowd of citizens who
had been crows met the crowd of citizens who
had been pigeons, and these were poor men
in poor clothes.</p>

<p>It would have done you good to see how the
ones who had been rich and crows ran to meet
the ones who had been pigeons and poor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come and stay at my house, brother,&rsquo; they
cried to those who had no homes. &lsquo;Brother, I
have many coats, come and choose some,&rsquo; they
cried to the ragged. &lsquo;Come and feast with
me!&rsquo; they cried to all. And the rich and the
poor went off arm in arm to feast and be glad
that night, and the next day to work side by
side. &lsquo;For,&rsquo; said the King, speaking with his
hand on the neck of the tamed dragon, &lsquo;our
land has been called Crownowland. But we are
no longer crows. We are men: and we will be
Just men. And our country shall be called
Justnowland for ever and ever. And for the
future we shall not be rich and poor, but fellow-workers,
and each will do his best for his
brothers and his own city. And your King
shall be your servant!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know how they managed this, but
no one seemed to think that there would be
any difficulty about it when the King
<a name="png.242" id="png.242"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">203</span><span class="ns">
 </span>mentioned it; and when people really make up
their minds to do anything, difficulties do most
oddly disappear.</p>

<p>Wonderful rejoicings there were. The
city was hung with flags and lamps. Bands
played&mdash;the performers a little out of practice,
because, of course, crows can&#8217;t play the flute or
the violin or the trombone&mdash;but the effect was
very gay indeed. Then came the time&mdash;it was
quite dark&mdash;when the King rose up on his
throne and spoke; and Elsie, among all her
new friends, listened with them to his words.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Our deliverer Elsie,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;was brought
hither by the good magic of our Chief Mage
and Prime Minister. She has removed the enchantment
that held us; and the dragon, now
that he has had his tea and recovered from the
shock of being kindly treated, turns out to be
the second strongest magician in the world,&mdash;and
he will help us and advise us, so long as
we remember that we are all brothers and
fellow-workers. And now comes the time
when our Elsie must return to her own place,
or another go in her stead. But we cannot
send back our heroine, our deliverer.&rsquo; (<i>Long,
loud cheering.</i>) &lsquo;So one shall take her place.
My <span class="nw">daughter&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>The end of the sentence was lost in shouts
of admiration. But Elsie stood up, small and
<a name="png.243" id="png.243"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">204</span><span class="ns">
 </span>white in her black frock, and said, &lsquo;No thank
you. Perdona would simply hate it. And she
doesn&#8217;t know my daddy. He&#8217;ll fetch me away
from Mrs. Staines some day&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The thought of her daddy, far away in India,
of the loneliness of Willow Farm, where now it
would be night in that horrible bare attic where
the poor dead untameable little mouse was,
nearly choked Elsie. It was so bright and
light and good and kind here. And India was
so far away. Her voice stayed a moment on a
broken note.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&mdash;I&hellip;.&rsquo; Then she spoke firmly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you all so much,&rsquo; she said&mdash;&lsquo;so very
much. I do love you all, and it&#8217;s lovely here.
But, please, I&#8217;d like to go home now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, in a silence full of love
and understanding, folded his dark cloak round
her.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>It was dark in the attic. Elsie crouching
alone in the blackness by the fireplace where
the dead mouse had been, put out her hand to
touch its cold fur.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>There were wheels on the gravel outside&mdash;the
knocker swung strongly&mdash;&lsquo;<em>Rat</em>-tat-tat-tat&mdash;<em>Tat</em>!
<em>Tat</em>!&rsquo; A pause&mdash;voices&mdash;hasty feet in
strong boots sounded on the stairs, the key

 </span>turned in the lock. The door opened a dazzling
crack, then fully, to the glare of a lamp carried
by Mrs. Staines.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come down at once. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re good
now,&rsquo; she said, in a great hurry and in a new
honeyed voice.</p>

<p>But there were other feet on the stairs&mdash;a
step that Elsie knew. &lsquo;Where&#8217;s my girl?&rsquo; the
voice she knew cried cheerfully. But under the
cheerfulness Elsie heard something other and
dearer. &lsquo;Where&#8217;s my girl?&rsquo;</p>

<p>After all, it takes less than a month to come
from India to the house in England where one&#8217;s
heart is.</p>

<p class="pgbrk">Out of the bare attic and the darkness Elsie
leapt into light, into arms she knew. &lsquo;Oh, my
daddy, my daddy!&rsquo; she cried. &lsquo;How glad I
am I came back!&rsquo;</p>

 /></span><b>IX</b><br
 />THE RELATED MUFF</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> had never seen our cousin Sidney till that
Christmas Eve, and we didn&#8217;t want to see him
then, and we didn&#8217;t like him when we did see
him. He was just dumped down into the
middle of us by mother, at a time when it
would have been unkind to her to say how
little we wanted him.</p>

<p>We knew already that there wasn&#8217;t to be
any proper Christmas for us, because Aunt
Ellie&mdash;the one who always used to send the
necklaces and carved things from India, and
remembered everybody&#8217;s birthday&mdash;had come
home ill. Very ill she was, at a hotel in
London, and mother had to go to her, and, of
course, father was away with his ship.</p>

<p>And then after we had said good-bye to
mother, and told her how sorry we were, we
were left to ourselves, and told each other what
a shame it was, and no presents or anything.
And then mother came suddenly back in a cab,
<a name="png.246" id="png.246"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">207</span><span class="ns">
 </span>and we all shouted &lsquo;Hooray&rsquo; when we saw the
cab stop, and her get out of it. And then we
saw she was getting something out of the cab,
and our hearts leapt up like the man&#8217;s in the
piece of school poetry when he beheld a rainbow
in the sky&mdash;because we thought she had
remembered about the presents, and the thing
she was getting out of the cab was <em>them</em>.</p>

<p>Of course it was not&mdash;it was Sidney, very
thin and yellow, and looking as sullen as a pig.</p>

<p>We opened the front door. Mother didn&#8217;t
even come in. She just said, &lsquo;Here&#8217;s your
Cousin Sidney. Be nice to him and give him
a good time, there&#8217;s darlings. And don&#8217;t
forget he&#8217;s your visitor, so be very extra nice
to him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I have sometimes thought it was the fault
of what mother said about the visitor that
made what did happen happen, but I am
almost sure really that it was the fault of us,
though I did not see it at the time, and even
now I&#8217;m sure we didn&#8217;t mean to be unkind.
Quite the opposite. But the events of life
are very confusing, especially when you try to
think what made you do them, and whether
you really meant to be naughty or not. Quite
often it is not&mdash;but it turns out just the same.</p>

<p>When the cab had carried mother away&mdash;Hilda
said it was like a dragon carrying away
<a name="png.247" id="png.247"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">208</span><span class="ns">
 </span>a queen&mdash;we said, &lsquo;How do you do&rsquo; to our
Cousin Sidney, who replied, &lsquo;Quite well, thank
you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then, curiously enough, no one could
think of anything more to say.</p>

<p>Then Rupert&mdash;which is me&mdash;remembered
that about being a visitor, and he said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Won&#8217;t you come into the drawing-room?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He did when he had taken off his gloves
and overcoat. There was a fire in the drawing-room,
because we had been going to have
games there with mother, only the telegram
came about Aunt Ellie.</p>

<p>So we all sat on chairs in the drawing-room,
and thought of nothing to say harder than ever.</p>

<p>Hilda did say, &lsquo;How old are you?&rsquo; but,
of course, we knew the answer to that. It
was ten.</p>

<p>And Hugh said, &lsquo;Do you like England or
India best?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And our cousin replied, &lsquo;India ever so
much, thank you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I never felt such a duffer. It was awful.
With all the millions of interesting things that
there are to say at other times, and I couldn&#8217;t
think of one. At last I said, &lsquo;Do you like
games?&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.248" id="png.248"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 width="650" height="437" alt="" title="" /><br
 />So we all sat on chairs in the drawing-room, and thought of nothing to say harder than ever.</p>
</div>

<p>And our cousin replied, &lsquo;Some games I do,&rsquo;
in a tone that made me sure that the games he
<a name="png.250" id="png.250"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">209</span><span class="ns">
 </span>liked wouldn&#8217;t be our kind, but some wild
Indian sort that we didn&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>I could see that the others were feeling just
like me, and I knew we could not go on like
this till tea-time. And yet I didn&#8217;t see any
other way to go on in. It was Hilda who cut
the Gorgeous knot at last. She said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Hugh, let you and I go and make a lovely
surprise for Rupert and Sidney.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And before I could think of any way of
stopping them without being downright rude
to our new cousin, they had fled the scene, just
like any old conspirators. Rupert&mdash;me, I mean&mdash;was
left alone with the stranger. I said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Is there anything you&#8217;d like to do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he said, &lsquo;No, thank you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then neither of us said anything for a bit&mdash;and
I could hear the others shrieking with
laughter in the hall.</p>

<p>I said, &lsquo;I wonder what the surprise will be
like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He said, &lsquo;Yes, I wonder&rsquo;; but I could tell
from his tone that he did not wonder a bit.</p>

<p>The others were yelling with laughter.
Have you ever noticed how very amused
people always are when you&#8217;re not there? If
you&#8217;re in bed&mdash;ill, or in disgrace, or anything&mdash;it
always sounds like far finer jokes than ever
occur when you are not out of things.</p>

<p><a name="png.251" id="png.251"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">210</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Do you like reading?&rsquo; said I&mdash;who am
Rupert&mdash;in the tones of despair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the cousin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then take a book,&rsquo; I said hastily, for I
really could not stand it another second, &lsquo;and
you just read till the surprise is ready. I think
I ought to go and help the others. I&#8217;m the
eldest, you know.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I did not wait&mdash;I suppose if you&#8217;re ten you
can choose a book for yourself&mdash;and I went.</p>

<p>Hilda&#8217;s idea was just Indians, but I thought
a wigwam would be nice. So we made one
with the hall table and the fur rugs off the
floor. If everything had been different, and
Aunt Ellie hadn&#8217;t been ill, we were to have had
turkey for dinner. The turkey&#8217;s feathers were
splendid for Indians, and the striped blankets
off Hugh&#8217;s and my beds, and all mother&#8217;s beads.
The hall is big like a room, and there was a fire.
The afternoon passed like a beautiful dream.
When Rupert had done his own feathering and
blanketing, as well as brown paper moccasins,
he helped the others. The tea-bell rang before
we were quite dressed. We got Louisa to go
up and tell our cousin that the surprise was
ready, and we all got inside the wigwam. It
was a very tight fit, with the feathers and the
blankets.</p>

<p>He came down the stairs very slowly, reading
<a name="png.252" id="png.252"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">211</span><span class="ns">
 </span>all the time, and when he got to the mat at
the bottom of the stairs we burst forth in all
our war-paint from the wigwam. It upset,
because Hugh and Hilda stuck between the
table&#8217;s legs, and it fell on the stone floor with
quite a loud noise. The wild Indians picked
themselves up out of the ruins and did the
finest war-dance I&#8217;ve ever seen in front of my
cousin Sidney.</p>

<p>He gave one little scream, and then sat
down suddenly on the bottom steps. He
leaned his head against the banisters and we
thought he was admiring the war-dance, till
Eliza, who had been laughing and making as
much noise as any one, suddenly went up to
him and shook him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop that noise,&rsquo; she said to us, &lsquo;he&#8217;s gone
off into a dead faint.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He had.</p>

<p>Of course we were very sorry and all that,
but we never thought he&#8217;d be such a muff as to
be frightened of three Red Indians and a wigwam
that happened to upset. He was put to
bed, and we had our teas.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish we hadn&#8217;t,&rsquo; Hilda said.</p>

<p>&lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; said Hugh.</p>

<p>But Rupert said, &lsquo;No one <em>could</em> have
expected a cousin of ours to be a chicken-hearted
duffer. He&#8217;s a muff. It&#8217;s bad enough
<a name="png.253" id="png.253"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">212</span><span class="ns">
 </span>to have a muff in the house at all, and at
Christmas time, too. But a related muff!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Still the affair had cast a gloom, and we
were glad when it was bed-time.</p>

<p>Next day was Christmas Day, and no
presents, and nobody but the servants to wish
a Merry Christmas to.</p>

<p>Our cousin Sidney came down to breakfast,
and as it was Christmas Day Rupert bent his
proud spirit to own he was sorry about the
Indians.</p>

<p>Sidney said, &lsquo;It doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m sorry
too. Only I didn&#8217;t expect it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>We suggested two or three games, such as
Parlour Cricket, National Gallery, and Grab&mdash;but
Sidney said he would rather read. So we
said would he mind if we played out the Indian
game which we had dropped, out of politeness,
when he fainted.</p>

<p>He said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t mind at all, now I know what it is
you&#8217;re up to. No, thank you, I&#8217;d rather read,&rsquo;
he added, in reply to Rupert&#8217;s unselfish offer to
dress him for the part of Sitting Bull.</p>

<p>So he read <cite>Treasure Island</cite>, and we fought on
the stairs with no casualties except the gas
globes, and then we scalped all the dolls&mdash;putting
on paper scalps first because Hilda
wished it&mdash;and we scalped Eliza as she passed
<a name="png.256" id="png.256"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">213</span><span class="ns">
 </span>through the hall&mdash;hers was a white scalp with
lacey stuff on it and long streamers.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.255" id="png.255"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 alt="" title="" /><br
 />&lsquo;We scalped Eliza as she passed through the hall.&rsquo;</p>
</div>

<p>And when it was beginning to get dark
we thought of flying machines. Of course
Sidney wouldn&#8217;t play at that either, and Hilda
and Hugh were contented with paper wings&mdash;there
were some rolls of rather decent yellow
and pink crinkled paper that mother had bought
to make lamp shades of. They made wings
of this, and then they played at fairies up and
down the stairs, while Sidney sat at the bottom
of the stairs and went on reading <cite>Treasure
Island</cite>. But Rupert was determined to have a
flying machine, with real flipper-flappery wings,
like at Hendon. So he got two brass fire-guards
out of the spare room and mother&#8217;s
bedroom, and covered them with newspapers
fastened on with string. Then he got a tea-tray
and fastened it on to himself with rug-straps,
and then he slipped his arms in between
the string and the fire-guards, and went to the
top of the stairs and shouting, &lsquo;Look out
below there! Beware Flying Machines!&rsquo; he
sat down suddenly on the tray, and tobogganed
gloriously down the stairs, flapping his fire-guard
wings. It was a great success, and felt more
like flying than anything he ever played at. But
Hilda had not had time to look out thoroughly,
because he did not wait any time between his
<a name="png.257" id="png.257"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">214</span><span class="ns">
 </span>warning and his descent. So that she was still
fluttering, in the character of Queen of the
Butterfly Fairies, about half-way down the stairs
when the flying machine, composed of the two
guards, the tea-tray, and Rupert, started from
the top of them, and she could only get out of
the way by standing back close against the wall.
Unluckily the place where she was, was also
the place where the gas was burning in a little
recess. You remember we had broken the
globe when we were playing Indians.</p>

<p>Now, of course, you know what happened,
because you have read <cite>Harriett and the Matches</cite>,
and all the rest of the stories that have been
written to persuade children not to play with
fire. No one was playing with fire that day, it
is true, or doing anything really naughty at
all&mdash;but however naughty we had been the
thing that happened couldn&#8217;t have been much
worse. For the flying machine as it came
rushing round the curve of the staircase banged
against the legs of Hilda. She screamed and
stumbled back. Her pink paper wings went
into the gas that hadn&#8217;t a globe. They flamed
up, her hair frizzled, and her lace collar caught
fire. Rupert could not do anything because he
was held fast in his flying machine, and he and
it were rolling painfully on the mat at the
bottom of the stairs.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.259" id="png.259"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span

 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-259.png" width="650" height="625"

 />Sidney threw the rug over her, and rolled her over and over.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="png.260" id="png.260"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">215</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>Hilda screamed.</p>

<p>I have since heard that a great yellow light
fell on the pages of <cite>Treasure Island</cite>.</p>

<p>Next moment <cite>Treasure Island</cite> went spinning
across the room. Sidney caught up the
fur rug that was part of the wigwam, and as
Hilda, screaming horribly, and with wings not
of paper but of flames, rushed down the staircase,
and stumbled over the flying machine,
Sidney threw the rug over her, and rolled her
over and over on the floor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lie down!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Lie down! It&#8217;s the
only way.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But somehow people never will lie down
when their clothes are on fire, any more than
they will lie still in the water if they think they
are drowning, and some one is trying to save
them. It came to something very like a
fight. Hilda fought and struggled. Rupert
got out of his fire-guards and added himself
and his tea-tray to the scrimmage. Hugh slid
down to the knob of the banisters and sat
there yelling. The servants came rushing in.</p>

<p>But by that time the fire was out. And
Sidney gasped out, &lsquo;It&#8217;s all right. You aren&#8217;t
burned, Hilda, are you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Hilda was much too frightened to know
whether she was burnt or not, but Eliza
looked her over, and it turned out that only
<a name="png.261" id="png.261"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">216</span><span class="ns">
 </span>her neck was a little scorched, and a good deal
of her hair frizzled off short.</p>

<p>Every one stood, rather breathless and pale,
and every one&#8217;s face was much dirtier than
customary, except Hugh&#8217;s, which he had, as
usual, dirtied thoroughly quite early in the
afternoon. Rupert felt perfectly awful, ashamed
and proud and rather sick. &lsquo;You&#8217;re a regular
hero, Sidney,&rsquo; he said&mdash;and it was not easy
to say&mdash;&lsquo;and yesterday I said you were a related
muff. And I&#8217;m jolly sorry I did. Shake
hands, won&#8217;t you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Sidney hesitated.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Too proud?&rsquo; Rupert&#8217;s feelings were hurt,
and I should not wonder if he spoke rather
fiercely.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s&mdash;it&#8217;s a little burnt, I think,&rsquo; said Sidney,
&lsquo;don&#8217;t be angry,&rsquo; and he held out the left hand.</p>

<p>Rupert grasped it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I do beg your pardon,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;you <em>are</em> a
hero!&rsquo;</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>Sidney&#8217;s hand was bad for ever so long,
but we were tremendous chums after that.</p>

<p>It was when they&#8217;d done the hand up with
scraped potato and salad oil&mdash;a great, big, fat, wet
plaster of it&mdash;that I said to him:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t care if you don&#8217;t like games. Let&#8217;s <!-- "Lets" sans apostrophe in original -->
be pals.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.262" id="png.262"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">217</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And he said, &lsquo;I do like games, but I couldn&#8217;t
care about anything with mother so ill. I
know you&#8217;ll think I&#8217;m a muff, but I&#8217;m not
really, only I do love her so.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with that he began to cry, and I
thumped him on the back, and told him exactly
what a beast I knew I was, to comfort him.</p>

<p>When Aunt Ellie was well again we kept
Christmas on the 6th of January, which used
to be Christmas Day in middle-aged times.</p>

<p>Father came home before New Year, and
he had a silver medal made, with a flame on
one side, and on the other Sidney&#8217;s name, and
&lsquo;For Bravery.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">If I had not been tied up in fire-guards and
tea-trays perhaps I should have thought of the
rug and got the medal. But I do not grudge
it to Sidney. He deserved it. And he is not
a muff. I see now that a person might very
well be frightened at finding Indians in the
hall of a strange house, especially if the person
had just come from the kind of India where the
Indians are quite a different sort, and much
milder, with no feathers and wigwams and war-dances,
but only dusky features and University
Degrees.</p>

 />THE AUNT AND AMABEL</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is not pleasant to be a fish out of water. To
be a cat in water is not what any one would
desire. To be in a temper is uncomfortable.
And no one can fully taste the joys of life if he
is in a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit. But by
far the most uncomfortable thing to be in is
disgrace, sometimes amusingly called Coventry
by the people who are not in it.</p>

<p>We have all been there. It is a place where
the heart sinks and aches, where familiar faces
are clouded and changed, where any remark
that one may tremblingly make is received with
stony silence or with the assurance that nobody
wants to talk to such a naughty child. If you
are only in disgrace, and not in solitary confinement,
you will creep about a house that is like
the one you have had such jolly times in, and
yet as unlike it as a bad dream is to a June
morning. You will long to speak to people,
and be afraid to speak. You will wonder
<a name="png.264" id="png.264"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">219</span><span class="ns">
 </span>whether there is anything you can do that will
change things at all. You have said you are
sorry, and that has changed nothing. You will
wonder whether you are to stay for ever in
this desolate place, outside all hope and love
and fun and happiness. And though it has
happened before, and has always, in the
end, come to an end, you can never be quite
sure that this time it is not going to last for
ever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It <em>is</em> going to last for ever,&rsquo; said Amabel,
who was eight. &lsquo;What shall I do? Oh whatever
shall I do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>What she <em>had</em> done ought to have formed the
subject of her meditations. And she had done
what had seemed to her all the time, and in
fact still seemed, a self-sacrificing and noble act.
She was staying with an aunt&mdash;measles or a
new baby, or the painters in the house, I forget
which, the cause of her banishment. And the
aunt, who was really a great-aunt and quite old
enough to know better, had been grumbling
about her head gardener to a lady who called
in blue spectacles and a beady bonnet with
violet flowers in it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He hardly lets me have a plant for the table,&rsquo;
said the aunt, &lsquo;and that border in front of the
breakfast-room window&mdash;it&#8217;s just bare earth&mdash;and
I expressly ordered chrysanthemums to be
<a name="png.265" id="png.265"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">220</span><span class="ns">
 </span>planted there. He thinks of nothing but his
greenhouse.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The beady-violet-blue-glassed lady snorted,
and said she didn&#8217;t know what we were coming
to, and she would have just half a cup, please, with
not quite so much milk, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Now what would you have done? Minded
your own business most likely, and not got into
trouble at all. Not so Amabel. Enthusiastically
anxious to do something which should make
the great-aunt see what a thoughtful, unselfish,
little girl she really was (the aunt&#8217;s opinion of
her being at present quite otherwise), she got
up very early in the morning and took the
cutting-out scissors from the work-room table
drawer and stole, &lsquo;like an errand of mercy,&rsquo; she
told herself, to the greenhouse where she
busily snipped off every single flower she could
find. MacFarlane was at his breakfast. Then
with the points of the cutting-out scissors she
made nice deep little holes in the flower-bed
where the chrysanthemums ought to have been,
and struck the flowers in&mdash;chrysanthemums,
geraniums, primulas, orchids, and carnations. It
would be a lovely surprise for Auntie.</p>

<p>Then the aunt came down to breakfast and
saw the lovely surprise. Amabel&#8217;s world turned
upside down and inside out suddenly and
surprisingly, and there she was, in Coventry,
<a name="png.266" id="png.266"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">221</span><span class="ns">
 </span>and not even the housemaid would speak to
her. Her great-uncle, whom she passed in the
hall on her way to her own room, did indeed, as
he smoothed his hat, murmur, &lsquo;Sent to Coventry,
eh? Never mind, it&#8217;ll soon be over,&rsquo; and
went off to the City banging the front door
behind him.</p>

<p>He meant well, but he did not understand.</p>

<p>Amabel understood, or she thought she did,
and knew in her miserable heart that she was
sent to Coventry for the last time, and that this
time she would stay there.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t care,&rsquo; she said quite untruly. &lsquo;I&#8217;ll
never try to be kind to any one again.&rsquo; And
that wasn&#8217;t true either. She was to spend the
whole day alone in the best bedroom, the one
with the four-post bed and the red curtains and
the large wardrobe with a looking-glass in it
that you could see yourself in to the very ends
of your strap-shoes.</p>

<p>The first thing Amabel did was to look at
herself in the glass. She was still sniffing and
sobbing, and her eyes were swimming in tears,
another one rolled down her nose as she
looked&mdash;that was very interesting. Another
rolled down, and that was the last, because as
soon as you get interested in watching your
tears they stop.</p>

<p>Next she looked out of the window, and saw
<a name="png.267" id="png.267"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">222</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the decorated flower-bed, just as she had left it,
very bright and beautiful.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, it <em>does</em> look nice,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I don&#8217;t
care what they say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then she looked round the room for
something to read; there was nothing. The
old-fashioned best bedrooms never did have
anything. Only on the large dressing-table,
on the left-hand side of the oval swing-glass,
was one book covered in red velvet, and on it,
very twistily embroidered in yellow silk and
mixed up with misleading leaves and squiggles
were the letters, A.B.C.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps it&#8217;s a picture alphabet,&rsquo; said Mabel,
and was quite pleased, though of course she
was much too old to care for alphabets. Only
when one is very unhappy and very dull, anything
is better than nothing. She opened the
book.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why, it&#8217;s only a time-table!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;I
suppose it&#8217;s for people when they want to go
away, and Auntie puts it here in case they
suddenly make up their minds to go, and feel
that they can&#8217;t wait another minute. I feel
like that, only it&#8217;s no good, and I expect other
people do too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had learned how to use the dictionary,
and this seemed to go the same way. She
looked up the names of all the places she knew.&mdash;Brighton
<a name="png.268" id="png.268"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">223</span><span class="ns">
 </span>where she had once spent a month,
Rugby where her brother was at school, and
Home, which was Amberley&mdash;and she saw the
times when the trains left for these places, and
wished she could go by those trains.</p>

<p>And once more she looked round the best
bedroom which was her prison, and thought of
the Bastille, and wished she had a toad to tame,
like the poor Viscount, or a flower to watch
growing, like Picciola, and she was very sorry
for herself, and very angry with her aunt, and
very grieved at the conduct of her parents&mdash;she
had expected better things from them&mdash;and
now they had left her in this dreadful
place where no one loved her, and no one
understood her.</p>

<p>There seemed to be no place for toads or
flowers in the best room, it was carpeted all
over even in its least noticeable corners. It
had everything a best room ought to have&mdash;and
everything was of dark shining mahogany.
The toilet-table had a set of red and gold glass
things&mdash;a tray, candlesticks, a ring-stand,
many little pots with lids, and two bottles with
stoppers. When the stoppers were taken out
they smelt very strange, something like very old
scent, and something like cold cream also very
old, and something like going to the dentist&#8217;s.</p>

<p>I do not know whether the scent of those
<a name="png.269" id="png.269"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">224</span><span class="ns">
 </span>bottles had anything to do with what happened.
It certainly was a very extraordinary scent.
Quite different from any perfume that I smell
nowadays, but I remember that when I was a
little girl I smelt it quite often. But then there
are no best rooms now such as there used to be.
The best rooms now are gay with chintz and
mirrors, and there are always flowers and books,
and little tables to put your teacup on, and sofas,
and armchairs. And they smell of varnish and
new furniture.</p>

<p>When Amabel had sniffed at both bottles
and looked in all the pots, which were quite
clean and empty except for a pearl button and
two pins in one of them, she took up the
A.B.C. again to look for Whitby, where her
godmother lived. And it was then that she
saw the extraordinary name &lsquo;<i>Whereyouwantogoto.</i>&rsquo;
This was odd&mdash;but the name of the
station from which it started was still more
extraordinary, for it was not Euston or Cannon
Street or Marylebone.</p>

<p>The name of the station was &lsquo;<i>Bigwardrobeinspareroom.</i>&rsquo;
And below this name, really
quite unusual for a station, Amabel read in
small letters:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Single fares strictly forbidden. Return
tickets No Class Nuppence. Trains leave
<i>Bigwardrobeinspareroom</i> all the time.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.270" id="png.270"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">225</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And under that in still smaller letters&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<i>You had better go now.</i>&rsquo;</p>

<p>What would you have done? Rubbed
your eyes and thought you were dreaming?
Well, if you had, nothing more would have
happened. Nothing ever does when you
behave like that. Amabel was wiser. She
went straight to the Big Wardrobe and turned
its glass handle.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I expect it&#8217;s only shelves and people&#8217;s best
hats,&rsquo; she said. But she only said it. People
often say what they don&#8217;t mean, so that if
things turn out as they don&#8217;t expect, they can
say &lsquo;I told you so,&rsquo; but this is most dishonest
to one&#8217;s self, and being dishonest to one&#8217;s self
is almost worse than being dishonest to other
people. Amabel would never have done it if
she had been herself. But she was out of
herself with anger and unhappiness.</p>

<p>Of course it wasn&#8217;t hats. It was, most
amazingly, a crystal cave, very oddly shaped
like a railway station. It seemed to be lighted
by stars, which is, of course, unusual in a
booking office, and over the station clock was a
full moon. The clock had no figures, only <i>Now</i>
in shining letters all round it, twelve times,
and the <i>Nows</i> touched, so the clock was bound
to be always right. How different from the
clock you go to school by!</p>

<p><a name="png.271" id="png.271"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">226</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>A porter in white satin hurried forward to
take Amabel&#8217;s luggage. Her luggage was the
A.B.C. which she still held in her hand.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lots of time, Miss,&rsquo; he said, grinning in a
most friendly way, &lsquo;I <em>am</em> glad you&#8217;re going.
You <em>will</em> enjoy yourself! What a nice little
girl you are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>This was cheering. Amabel smiled.</p>

<p>At the pigeon-hole that tickets come out of,
another person, also in white satin, was ready
with a mother-of-pearl ticket, round, like a
card counter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here you are, Miss,&rsquo; he said with the
kindest smile, &lsquo;price nothing, and refreshments
free all the way. It&#8217;s a pleasure,&rsquo; he added, &lsquo;to
issue a ticket to a nice little lady like you.&rsquo;
The train was entirely of crystal, too, and the
cushions were of white satin. There were
little buttons such as you have for electric
bells, and on them &lsquo;<i>Whatyouwantoeat</i>,&rsquo; &lsquo;<i>Whatyouwantodrink</i>,&rsquo;
&lsquo;<i>Whatyouwantoread</i>,&rsquo; in silver
letters.</p>

<p>Amabel pressed all the buttons at once, and
instantly felt obliged to blink. The blink over,
she saw on the cushion by her side a silver
tray with vanilla ice, boiled chicken and white
sauce, almonds (blanched), peppermint creams,
and mashed potatoes, and a long glass of
lemonade&mdash;beside the tray was a book. It was
<a name="png.272" id="png.272"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">227</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Mrs. Ewing&#8217;s <cite>Bad-tempered Family</cite>, and it
was bound in white vellum.</p>

<p>There is nothing more luxurious than eating
while you read&mdash;unless it be reading while you
eat. Amabel did both: they are not the same
thing, as you will see if you think the matter
over.</p>

<p>And just as the last thrill of the last spoonful
of ice died away, and the last full stop of the
<cite>Bad-tempered Family</cite> met Amabel&#8217;s eye,
the train stopped, and hundreds of railway
officials in white velvet shouted, &lsquo;<i>Whereyouwantogoto!</i>
Get out!&rsquo;</p>

<p>A velvety porter, who was somehow like a
silkworm as well as like a wedding handkerchief
sachet, opened the door.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now!&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;come on out, Miss Amabel,
unless you want to go to <i>Whereyoudon&#8217;twantogoto</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She hurried out, on to an ivory platform.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not on the ivory, if you please,&rsquo; said the
porter, &lsquo;the white Axminster carpet&mdash;it&#8217;s laid
down expressly for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Amabel walked along it and saw ahead of
her a crowd, all in white.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What&#8217;s all that?&rsquo; she asked the friendly
porter.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s the Mayor, dear Miss Amabel,&rsquo; he said, <!-- Transcriber's note: original shows a period in place of comma -->
&lsquo;with your address.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.273" id="png.273"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">228</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;My address is The Old Cottage, Amberley,&rsquo;
she said, &lsquo;at least it used to be&rsquo;&mdash;and found
herself face to face with the Mayor. He was
very like Uncle George, but he bowed low to
her, which was not Uncle George&#8217;s habit, and
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Welcome, dear little Amabel. Please accept
this admiring address from the Mayor and
burgesses and apprentices and all the rest of it,
of Whereyouwantogoto.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The address was in silver letters, on white
silk, and it said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Welcome, dear Amabel. We know you
meant to please your aunt. It was very clever
of you to think of putting the greenhouse
flowers in the bare flower-bed. You couldn&#8217;t
be expected to know that you ought to ask
leave before you touch other people&#8217;s things.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, but,&rsquo; said Amabel quite confused. &lsquo;I
did&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>But the band struck up, and drowned her
words. The instruments of the band were
all of silver, and the bandsmen&#8217;s clothes of
white leather. The tune they played was
&lsquo;Cheero!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Then Amabel found that she was taking
part in a procession, hand in hand with the
Mayor, and the band playing like mad all the
time. The Mayor was dressed entirely in cloth
<a name="png.274" id="png.274"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">229</span><span class="ns">
 </span>of silver, and as they went along he kept
saying, close to her ear.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You have our sympathy, you have our
sympathy,&rsquo; till she felt quite giddy.</p>

<p>There was a flower show&mdash;all the flowers
were white. There was a concert&mdash;all the
tunes were old ones. There was a play called
<cite>Put yourself in her place</cite>. And there was a
banquet, with Amabel in the place of honour.</p>

<p>They drank her health in white wine whey,
and then through the Crystal Hall of a thousand
gleaming pillars, where thousands of guests, all
in white, were met to do honour to Amabel,
the shout went up&mdash;&lsquo;Speech, speech!&rsquo;</p>

<p>I cannot explain to you what had been
going on in Amabel&#8217;s mind. Perhaps you
know. Whatever it was it began like a very
tiny butterfly in a box, that could not keep
quiet, but fluttered, and fluttered, and fluttered.
And when the Mayor rose and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dear Amabel, you whom we all love and
understand; dear Amabel, you who were so
unjustly punished for trying to give pleasure to
an unresponsive aunt; poor, ill-used, ill-treated,
innocent Amabel; blameless, suffering Amabel,
we await your words,&rsquo; that fluttering, tiresome
butterfly-thing inside her seemed suddenly to
swell to the size and strength of a fluttering
albatross, and Amabel got up from her seat of
<a name="png.275" id="png.275"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">230</span><span class="ns">
 </span>honour on the throne of ivory and silver and
pearl, and said, choking a little, and extremely
red about the ears&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ladies and gentlemen, I don&#8217;t want to
make a speech, I just want to say, &ldquo;Thank
you,&rdquo; and to say&mdash;to say&mdash;to say&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She stopped, and all the white crowd cheered.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To say,&rsquo; she went on as the cheers died
down, &lsquo;that I wasn&#8217;t blameless, and innocent,
and all those nice things. I ought to have
thought. And they <em>were</em> Auntie&#8217;s flowers. But
I did want to please her. It&#8217;s all so mixed.
Oh, I wish Auntie was here!&rsquo;</p>

<p>And instantly Auntie <em>was</em> there, very tall
and quite nice-looking, in a white velvet dress
and an ermine cloak.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Speech,&rsquo; cried the crowd. &lsquo;Speech from
Auntie!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Auntie stood on the step of the throne
beside Amabel, and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think, perhaps, I was hasty. And I
think Amabel meant to please me. But all the
flowers that were meant for the winter &hellip;
well&mdash;I was annoyed. I&#8217;m sorry.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Auntie, so am I&mdash;so am I,&rsquo; cried
Amabel, and the two began to hug each other
on the ivory step, while the crowd cheered like
mad, and the band struck up that well-known
air, &lsquo;If you only understood!&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.276" id="png.276"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">231</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh, Auntie,&rsquo; said Amabel among hugs,
&lsquo;This is such a lovely place, come and see
everything, we may, mayn&#8217;t we?&rsquo; she asked
the Mayor.</p>

<p>&lsquo;The place is yours,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;and now you
can see many things that you couldn&#8217;t see
before. We are The People who Understand.
And now you are one of Us. And your aunt
is another.&rsquo;</p>

<p>I must not tell you all that they saw because
these things are secrets only known to The
People who Understand, and perhaps you do
not yet belong to that happy nation. And if
you do, you will know without my telling you.</p>

<p>And when it grew late, and the stars
were drawn down, somehow, to hang among
the trees, Amabel fell asleep in her aunt&#8217;s
arms beside a white foaming fountain on a
marble terrace, where white peacocks came to
drink.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>She awoke on the big bed in the spare
room, but her aunt&#8217;s arms were still round her.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Amabel,&rsquo; she was saying, &lsquo;Amabel!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, Auntie,&rsquo; said Amabel sleepily, &lsquo;I am so
sorry. It <em>was</em> stupid of me. And I did mean
to please you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It <em>was</em> stupid of you,&rsquo; said the aunt, &lsquo;but I
am sure you meant to please me. Come down
<a name="png.277" id="png.277"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">232</span><span class="ns">
 </span>to supper.&rsquo; And Amabel has a confused
recollection of her aunt&#8217;s saying that she was
sorry, adding, &lsquo;Poor little Amabel.&rsquo;</p>

<p>If the aunt really did say it, it was fine of
her. And Amabel is quite sure that she did
say it.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>Amabel and her great-aunt are now the
best of friends. But neither of them has ever
spoken to the other of the beautiful city called
&lsquo;<i>Whereyouwantogoto.</i>&rsquo; Amabel is too shy to
be the first to mention it, and no doubt the
aunt has her own reasons for not broaching
the subject.</p>

<p>But of course they both know that they have
been there together, and it is easy to get on
with people when you and they alike belong to
the <i>Peoplewhounderstand</i>.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p class="pgbrk">If you look in the A.B.C. that your people
have you will not find &lsquo;<i>Whereyouwantogoto.</i>&rsquo;
It is only in the red velvet bound copy that
Amabel found in her aunt&#8217;s best bedroom.</p>

 /></span><b>XI</b><br
 />KENNETH AND THE CARP</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Kenneth&#8217;s</span> cousins had often stayed with him,
but he had never till now stayed with them.
And you know how different everything is when
you are in your own house. You are certain
exactly what games the grown-ups dislike and
what games they will not notice; also what
sort of mischief is looked over and what
sort is not. And, being accustomed to your
own sort of grown-ups, you can always be
pretty sure when you are likely to catch it.
Whereas strange houses are, in this matter
of catching it, full of the most unpleasing
surprises.</p>

<p>You know all this. But Kenneth did not.
And still less did he know what were the sort
of things which, in his cousins&#8217; house, led to
disapproval, punishment, scoldings; in short, to
catching it. So that that business of cousin
Ethel&#8217;s jewel-case, which is where this story
ought to begin, was really not Kenneth&#8217;s fault
<a name="png.279" id="png.279"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">234</span><span class="ns">
 </span>at all. Though for a time&hellip;. But I am getting
on too fast.</p>

<p>Kenneth&#8217;s cousins were four,&mdash;Conrad,
Alison, George, and Ethel. The three first were
natural sort of cousins somewhere near his own
age, but Ethel was hardly like a cousin at all,
more like an aunt. Because she was grown-up.
She wore long dresses and all her hair on the
top of her head, a mass of combs and hairpins;
in fact she had just had her twenty-first birthday
with iced cakes and a party and lots of
presents, most of them jewelry. And that
brings me again to that affair of the jewel-case,
or would bring me if I were not determined to
tell things in their proper order, which is the
first duty of a story-teller.</p>

<p>Kenneth&#8217;s home was in Kent, a wooden
house among cherry orchards, and the nearest
river five miles away. That was why he
looked forward in such a very extra and excited
way to his visit to his cousins. Their house
was very old, red brick with ivy all over it. It
had a secret staircase, only the secret was not
kept any longer, and the housemaids carried
pails and brooms up and down the staircase.
And the house was surrounded by a real deep
moat, with clear water in it, and long weeds and
water-lilies and fish&mdash;the gold and the silver
and the everyday kinds.</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.281" id="png.281"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">opp p235</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-281.png" width="700" height="361"
 alt="" title="" /><br
 />Early next morning he tried to catch fish with several pieces of string knotted together and a hairpin.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="png.282" id="png.282"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">235</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>The first evening of Kenneth&#8217;s visit passed
uneventfully. His bedroom window looked
over the moat, and early next morning he tried
to catch fish with several pieces of string
knotted together and a hairpin kindly lent to
him by the parlourmaid. He did not catch any
fish, partly because he baited the hairpin with
brown windsor soap, and it washed off.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Besides, fish hate soap,&rsquo; Conrad told him,
&lsquo;and that hook of yours would do for a whale
perhaps. Only we don&#8217;t stock our moat with
whales. But I&#8217;ll ask father to lend you his
rod, it&#8217;s a spiffing one, much jollier than ours.
And I won&#8217;t tell the kids because they&#8217;d never
let it down on you. Fishing with a hairpin!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you very much,&rsquo; said <ins class="TN" title="Transcriber's note:
 original reads 'Kennth'">Kenneth</ins>, feeling
that his cousin was a man and a brother.
The kids were only two or three years younger
than he was, but that is a great deal when you
are the elder; and besides, one of the kids was
a girl.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alison&#8217;s a bit of a sneak,&rsquo; Conrad used to
say when anger overcome politeness and
brotherly feeling. Afterwards, when the anger
was gone and the other things left, he would
say, &lsquo;You see she went to a beastly school for
a bit, at Brighton, for her health. And father
says they must have bullied her. All girls are
not like it, I believe.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.283" id="png.283"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">236</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But her sneakish qualities, if they really
existed, were generally hidden, and she was
very clever at thinking of new games, and very
kind if you got into a row over anything.</p>

<p>George was eight and stout. He was not a
sneak, but concealment was foreign to his
nature, so he never could keep a secret unless
he forgot it. Which fortunately happened
quite often.</p>

<p>The uncle very amiably lent Kenneth his
fishing-rod, and provided real bait in the most
thoughtful and generous manner. And the
four children fished all the morning and all the
afternoon. Conrad caught two roach and an
eel. George caught nothing, and nothing was
what the other two caught. But it was glorious
sport. And the next day there was to be a
picnic. Life to Kenneth seemed full of new
and delicious excitement.</p>

<p>In the evening the aunt and the uncle
went out to dinner, and Ethel, in her grown-up
way, went with them, very grand in a blue silk
dress and turquoises. So the children were
left to themselves.</p>

<p>You know the empty hush which settles
down on a house when the grown-ups have
gone out to dinner and you have the whole
evening to do what you like in. The children
stood in the hall a moment after the carriage
<a name="png.284" id="png.284"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">237</span><span class="ns">
 </span>wheels had died away with the scrunching
swish that the carriage wheels always made as
they turned the corner by the lodge, where
the gravel was extra thick and soft owing to
the droppings from the trees. From the
kitchen came the voices of the servants, laughing
and talking.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s two hours at least to bedtime,&rsquo; said
Alison. &lsquo;What shall we do?&rsquo; Alison always
began by saying &lsquo;What shall we do?&rsquo; and
always ended by deciding what should be done.
&lsquo;You all say what you think,&rsquo; she went on,
&lsquo;and then we&#8217;ll vote about it. You first, Ken,
because you&#8217;re the visitor.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Fishing,&rsquo; said Kenneth, because it was the
only thing he could think of.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Make toffee,&rsquo; said Conrad.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Build a great big house with all the bricks,&rsquo;
said George.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We can&#8217;t make toffee,&rsquo; Alison explained
gently but firmly, &lsquo;because you know what the
pan was like last time, and cook said, &ldquo;never
again, not much.&rdquo; And it&#8217;s no good building
houses, Georgie, when you could be out of
doors. And fishing&#8217;s simply rotten when we&#8217;ve
been at it all day. I&#8217;ve thought of something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So of course all the others said, &lsquo;What?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;We&#8217;ll have a pageant, a river pageant, on
<a name="png.285" id="png.285"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">238</span><span class="ns">
 </span>the moat. We&#8217;ll all dress up and hang Chinese
lanterns in the trees. I&#8217;ll be the Sunflower
lady that the Troubadour came all across the
sea, because he loved her so, for, and one of
you can be the Troubadour, and the others can
be sailors or anything you like.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall be the Troubadour,&rsquo; said Conrad
with decision.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I think you ought to let Kenneth because
he&#8217;s the visitor,&rsquo; said George, who would have
liked to be it immensely himself, or anyhow
did not see why Conrad should be a troubadour
if <em>he</em> couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>Conrad said what manners required, which
was:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! all right, I don&#8217;t care about being the
beastly Troubadour.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You might be the Princess&#8217;s brother,&rsquo;
Alison suggested.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Not me,&rsquo; said Conrad scornfully, &lsquo;I&#8217;ll be
the captain of the ship.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;In a turban the brother would be, with the
Benares cloak, and the Persian dagger out of
the cabinet in the drawing-room,&rsquo; Alison went
on unmoved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll be that,&rsquo; said George.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, you won&#8217;t, I shall, so there,&rsquo; said
Conrad. &lsquo;You can be the captain of the ship.&rsquo;</p>

<p>(But in the end both boys were captains,
<a name="png.286" id="png.286"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">239</span><span class="ns">
 </span>because that meant being on the boat, whereas
being the Princess&#8217;s brother, however turbanned,
only meant standing on the bank.
And there is no rule to prevent captains wearing
turbans and Persian daggers, except in the
Navy where, of course, it is not done.)</p>

<p>So then they all tore up to the attic where
the dressing-up trunk was, and pulled out all
the dressing-up things on to the floor. And
all the time they were dressing, Alison was
telling the others what they were to say and
do. The Princess wore a white satin skirt and
a red flannel blouse and a veil formed of several
motor scarves of various colours. Also a
wreath of pink roses off one of Ethel&#8217;s old hats,
and a pair of pink satin slippers with sparkly
buckles.</p>

<p>Kenneth wore a blue silk dressing-jacket
and a yellow sash, a lace collar, and a towel
turban. And the others divided between them
an eastern dressing-gown, once the property of
their grandfather, a black spangled scarf, very
holey, a pair of red and white football stockings,
a Chinese coat, and two old muslin curtains,
which, rolled up, made turbans of enormous
size and fierceness.</p>

<p>On the landing outside cousin Ethel&#8217;s open
door Alison paused and said, &lsquo;I say!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! come on,&rsquo; said Conrad, &lsquo;we haven&#8217;t
<a name="png.287" id="png.287"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">240</span><span class="ns">
 </span>fixed the Chinese lanterns yet, and it&#8217;s getting
dark.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You go on,&rsquo; said Alison, &lsquo;I&#8217;ve just thought
of something.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The children were allowed to play in the
boat so long as they didn&#8217;t loose it from its
moorings. The painter was extremely long,
and quite the effect of coming home from a
long voyage was produced when the three boys
pushed the boat out as far as it would go
among the boughs of the beech-tree which
overhung the water, and then reappeared in
the circle of red and yellow light thrown by
the Chinese lanterns.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What ho! ashore there!&rsquo; shouted the
captain.</p>

<p>&lsquo;What ho!&rsquo; said a voice from the shore
which, Alison explained, was disguised.</p>

<p>&lsquo;We be three poor mariners,&rsquo; said Conrad by
a happy effort of memory, &lsquo;just newly come to
shore. We seek news of the Princess of Tripoli.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;She&#8217;s in her palace,&rsquo; said the disguised
voice, &lsquo;wait a minute, and I&#8217;ll tell her you&#8217;re
here. But what do you want her for? (&ldquo;A
poor minstrel of France&rdquo;) go on, Con.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A poor minstrel of France,&rsquo; said Conrad,
&lsquo;(all right! I remember,) who has heard of the
Princess&#8217;s beauty has come to lay, to <span class="nw">lay&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;His heart,&rsquo; said Alison.</p>

</div>

<p><a name="png.290" id="png.290"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">241</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;All right, I know. His heart at her something
or other feet.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Pretty feet,&rsquo; said Alison. &lsquo;I go to tell the
Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Next moment from the shadows on the
bank a radiant vision stepped into the circle of
light, crying&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! Rudel, is it indeed thou? Thou art
come at last. O welcome to the arms of the
Princess!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do I do now?&rsquo; whispered Rudel
(who was Kenneth) in the boat, and at the
same moment Conrad and George said, as with
one voice&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My hat! Alison, won&#8217;t you catch it!&rsquo;</p>

<p>For at the end of the Princess&#8217;s speech she
had thrown back her veils and revealed a blaze
of splendour. She wore several necklaces, one
of seed pearls, one of topazes, and one of
Australian shells, besides a string of amber
and one of coral. And the front of the red
flannel blouse was studded with brooches, in
one at least of which diamonds gleamed. Each
arm had one or two bracelets and on her
clenched hands glittered as many rings as any
Princess could wish to wear.</p>

<p>So her brothers had some excuse for saying,
&lsquo;You&#8217;ll catch it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t. It&#8217;s my look out, anyhow.
<a name="png.291" id="png.291"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">242</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Do shut up,&rsquo; said the Princess, stamping her
foot. &lsquo;Now then, Ken, go ahead. Ken, you
say, &ldquo;Oh Lady, I faint with rapture!&rdquo;&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I faint with rapture,&rsquo; said Kenneth stolidly.
&lsquo;Now I land, don&#8217;t I?&rsquo;</p>

<p>He landed and stared at the jewelled hand
the Princess held out.</p>

<p>&lsquo;At last, at last,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;but you ought
to say that, Ken. I say, I think I&#8217;d better be
an eloping Princess, and then I can come in
the boat. Rudel dies really, but that&#8217;s so dull.
Lead me to your ship, oh noble stranger! for
you have won the Princess, and with you I will
live and die. Give me your hand, can&#8217;t you,
silly, and do mind my train.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So Kenneth led her to the boat, and with
some difficulty, for the satin train got between
her feet, she managed to flounder into the punt.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now you stand and bow,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Fair
Rudel, with this ring I thee wed,&rsquo; she pressed a
large amethyst ring into his hand, &lsquo;remember
that the Princess of Tripoli is yours for ever.
Now let&#8217;s sing <cite>Integer Vitae</cite> because it&#8217;s Latin.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they sat in the boat and sang. And
presently the servants came out to listen and
admire, and at the sound of the servants&rsquo;
approach the Princess veiled her shining
splendour.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It&#8217;s prettier than wot the Coventry pageant
<a name="png.292" id="png.292"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">243</span><span class="ns">
 </span>was, so it is,&rsquo; said the cook, &lsquo;but it&#8217;s long past
your bed times. So come on out of that there
dangerous boat, there&#8217;s dears.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So then the children went to bed. And
when the house was quiet again, Alison slipped
down and put back Ethel&#8217;s jewelry, fitting the
things into their cases and boxes as correctly as
she could. &lsquo;Ethel won&#8217;t notice,&rsquo; she thought,
but of course Ethel did.</p>

<p>So that next day each child was asked
separately by Ethel&#8217;s mother who had been
playing with Ethel&#8217;s jewelry. And Conrad
and George said they would rather not say.
This was a form they always used in that
family when that sort of question was asked,
and it meant, &lsquo;It wasn&#8217;t me, and I don&#8217;t want
to sneak.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And when it came to Alison&#8217;s turn, she found
to her surprise and horror that instead of saying,
&lsquo;I played with them,&rsquo; she had said, &lsquo;I would
rather not say.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Of course the mother thought that it was
Kenneth who had had the jewels to play
with. So when it came to his turn he was not
asked the same question as the others, but his
aunt said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Kenneth, you are a very naughty little boy
to take your cousin Ethel&#8217;s jewelry to play with.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Kenneth.</p>

<p><a name="png.293" id="png.293"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">244</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Hush! hush!&rsquo; said the aunt, &lsquo;do not make
your fault worse by untruthfulness. And what
have you done with the amethyst ring?&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kenneth was just going to say that he had
given it back to Alison, when he saw that this
would be sneakish. So he said, getting hot to
the ears, &lsquo;You don&#8217;t suppose I&#8217;ve stolen your
beastly ring, do you, Auntie?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t you dare to speak to me like that,&rsquo;
the aunt very naturally replied. &lsquo;No, Kenneth,
I do not think you would steal, but the ring is
missing and it must be found.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kenneth was furious and frightened. He
stood looking down and kicking the leg of the
chair.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You had better look for it. You will have
plenty of time, because I shall not allow you to
go to the picnic with the others. The mere
taking of the jewelry was wrong, but if you had
owned your fault and asked Ethel&#8217;s pardon, I
should have overlooked it. But you have told
me an untruth and you have lost the ring.
You are a very wicked child, and it will make
your dear mother very unhappy when she
hears of it. That her boy should be a liar.
It is worse than being a thief!&rsquo;</p>

<p>At this Kenneth&#8217;s fortitude gave way, and he
lost his head. &lsquo;Oh, don&#8217;t,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I didn&#8217;t.
I didn&#8217;t. I didn&#8217;t. Oh! don&#8217;t tell mother I&#8217;m
<a name="png.294" id="png.294"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">245</span><span class="ns">
 </span>a thief and a liar. Oh! Aunt Effie, please,
<em>please</em> don&#8217;t.&rsquo; And with that he began to cry.</p>

<p>Any doubts Aunt Effie might have had
were settled by this outbreak. It was now
quite plain to her that Kenneth had really
intended to keep the ring.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will remain in your room till the picnic
party has started,&rsquo; the aunt went on, &lsquo;and then
you must find the ring. Remember I expect
it to be found when I return. And I hope you
will be in a better frame of mind and really
sorry for having been so wicked.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Mayn&#8217;t I see Alison?&rsquo; was all he found to
say.</p>

<p>And the answer was, &lsquo;Certainly not. I
cannot allow you to associate with your cousins.
You are not fit to be with honest, truthful
children.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So they all went to the picnic, and Kenneth
was left alone. When they had gone he crept
down and wandered furtively through the
empty rooms, ashamed to face the servants,
and feeling almost as wicked as though he had
really done something wrong. He thought
about it all, over and over again, and the more
he thought the more certain he was that he
<em>had</em> handed back the ring to Alison last night
when the voices of the servants were first
heard from the dark lawn.</p>

<p><a name="png.295" id="png.295"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">246</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>But what was the use of saying so? No
one would believe him, and it would be sneaking
anyhow. Besides, perhaps he <em>hadn&#8217;t</em>
handed it back to her. Or rather, perhaps
he had handed it and she hadn&#8217;t taken it.
Perhaps it had slipped into the boat. He
would go and see.</p>

<p>But he did not find it in the boat, though
he turned up the carpet and even took up the
boards to look. And then an extremely miserable
little boy began to search for an amethyst
ring in all sorts of impossible places, indoors
and out. You know the hopeless way in which
you look for things that you know perfectly
well you will never find, the borrowed penknife
that you dropped in the woods, for
instance, or the week&#8217;s pocket-money which
slipped through that hole in your pocket as
you went to the village to spend it.</p>

<p>The servants gave him his meals and told
him to cheer up. But cheering up and Kenneth
were, for the time, strangers. People in books
never can eat when they are in trouble, but I
have noticed myself that if the trouble has gone
on for some hours, eating is really rather a
comfort. You don&#8217;t enjoy eating so much as
usual, perhaps, but at any rate it is something
to do, and takes the edge off your sorrow for a
short time. And cook was sorry for Kenneth
<a name="png.296" id="png.296"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">247</span><span class="ns">
 </span>and sent him up a very nice dinner and a very
nice tea. Roast chicken and gooseberry pie
the dinner was, and for tea there was cake
with almond icing on it.</p>

<p>The sun was very low when he went back
wearily to have one more look in the boat for
that detestable amethyst ring. Of course it
was not there. And the picnic party would be
home soon. And he really did not know what
his aunt would do to him.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Shut me up in a dark cupboard, perhaps,&rsquo;
he thought gloomily, &lsquo;or put me to bed all day
to-morrow. Or give me lines to write out,
thousands, and thousands, and thousands, and
thousands, and thousands, of them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The boat, set in motion by his stepping into
it, swung out to the full length of its rope. The
sun was shining almost level across the water.
It was a very still evening, and the reflections
of the trees and of the house were as distinct as
the house and the trees themselves. And the
water was unusually clear. He could see the
fish swimming about, and the sand and pebbles
at the bottom of the moat. How clear and
quiet it looked down there, and what fun the
fishes seemed to be having.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish I was a fish,&rsquo; said Kenneth. &lsquo;Nobody
punishes <em>them</em> for taking rings they <em>didn&#8217;t</em>
take.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.297" id="png.297"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">248</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>And then suddenly he saw the ring itself,
lying calm, and quiet, and round, and shining,
on the smooth sand at the bottom of the moat.</p>

<p>He reached for the boat-hook and leaned
over the edge of the boat trying to get up the
ring on the boat-hook&#8217;s point. Then there
was a splash.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Good gracious! I wonder what that is?&rsquo;
said cook in the kitchen, and dropped the
saucepan with the welsh rabbit in it which she
had just made for kitchen supper.</p>

<p>Kenneth had leaned out too far over the
edge of the boat, the boat had suddenly
decided to go the other way, and Kenneth had
fallen into the water.</p>

<p>The first thing he felt was delicious coolness,
the second that his clothes had gone, and the
next thing he noticed was that he was swimming
quite easily and comfortably under water,
and that he had no trouble with his breathing,
such as people who tell you not to fall into
water seem to expect you to have. Also he
could see quite well, which he had never been
able to do under water before.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&#8217;t think,&rsquo; he said to himself, &lsquo;why
people make so much fuss about your falling
into the water. I sha&#8217;n&#8217;t be in a hurry to get
out. I&#8217;ll swim right round the moat while I&#8217;m
about it.&rsquo;</p>

<div class="illus">
<p><a name="png.298" id="png.298"></a><span class="ns">[</span><span
 class="pgmark">opp p248</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span><img class="framed" src="images/illus-298.png"
 width="403" height="700" alt="" title="" /><br
 />There was a splash.</p>
</div>

<p><a name="png.300" id="png.300"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">249</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>It was a very much longer swim than he
expected, and as he swam he noticed one or
two things that struck him as rather odd. One
was that he couldn&#8217;t see his hands. And
another was that he couldn&#8217;t feel his feet.
And he met some enormous fishes, like great
cod or halibut, they seemed. He had had no
idea that there were fresh-water fish of that
size.</p>

<p>They towered above him more like men-o&#8217;-war
than fish, and he was rather glad to get
past them. There were numbers of smaller
fishes, some about his own size, he thought.
They seemed to be enjoying themselves
extremely, and he admired the clever quickness
with which they darted out of the way of
the great hulking fish.</p>

<p>And then suddenly he ran into something
hard and very solid, and a voice above him
said crossly:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now then, who are you a-shoving of? Can&#8217;t
you keep your eyes open, and keep your nose
out of gentlemen&#8217;s shirt fronts?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Kenneth, trying
to rub his nose, and not being able to. &lsquo;I
didn&#8217;t know people could talk under water,&rsquo; he
added very much astonished to find that talking
under water was as easy to him as swimming
there.</p>

<p><a name="png.301" id="png.301"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">250</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Fish can talk under water, of course,&rsquo; said
the voice, &lsquo;if they didn&#8217;t, they&#8217;d never talk at
all: they certainly can&#8217;t talk <em>out</em> of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I&#8217;m not a fish,&rsquo; said Kenneth, and felt
himself grin at the absurd idea.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes, you are,&rsquo; said the voice, &lsquo;of course
you&#8217;re a fish,&rsquo; and Kenneth, with a shiver of
certainty, felt that the voice spoke the truth.
He <em>was</em> a fish. He must have become a fish
at the very moment when he fell into the
water. That accounted for his not being able
to see his hands or feel his feet. Because of
course his hands were fins and his feet were a
tail.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; he asked the voice, and his
own voice trembled.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m the Doyen Carp,&rsquo; said the voice.
&lsquo;You must be a very new fish indeed or
you&#8217;d know that. Come up, and let&#8217;s have a
look at you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>Kenneth came up and found himself face
to face with an enormous fish who had round
staring eyes and a mouth that opened and shut
continually. It opened square like a kit-bag,
and it shut with an extremely sour and severe
expression like that of an offended rhinoceros.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Carp, &lsquo;you <em>are</em> a new fish.
Who put you in?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I fell in,&rsquo; said Kenneth, &lsquo;out of the boat,
<a name="png.302" id="png.302"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">251</span><span class="ns">
 </span>but I&#8217;m not a fish at all, really I&#8217;m not. I&#8217;m a
boy, but I don&#8217;t suppose you&#8217;ll believe me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why shouldn&#8217;t I believe you?&rsquo; asked the
Carp wagging a slow fin. &lsquo;Nobody tells untruths
under water.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And if you come to think of it, no one ever
does.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Tell me your true story,&rsquo; said the Carp
very lazily. And Kenneth told it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah! these humans!&rsquo; said the Carp when
he had done. &lsquo;Always in such a hurry to think
the worst of everybody!&rsquo; He opened his
mouth squarely and shut it contemptuously.
&lsquo;You&#8217;re jolly lucky, you are. Not one boy in
a million turns into a fish, let me tell you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Do you mean that I&#8217;ve got to <em>go on</em> being
a fish?&rsquo; Kenneth asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course you&#8217;ll go on being a fish as long
as you stop in the water. You couldn&#8217;t live
here, you know, if you weren&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I might if I was an eel,&rsquo; said Kenneth, and
thought himself very clever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, <em>be</em> an eel then,&rsquo; said the Carp, and
swam away sneering and stately. Kenneth
had to swim his hardest to catch up.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then if I get out of the water, shall I be a
boy again?&rsquo; he asked panting.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course, silly,&rsquo; said the Carp, &lsquo;only you
can&#8217;t get out.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.303" id="png.303"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">252</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Oh! can&#8217;t I?&rsquo; said Kenneth the fish,
whisked his tail and swam off. He went
straight back to the amethyst ring, picked it up
in his mouth, and swam into the shallows at
the edge of the moat. Then he tried to climb
up the slanting mud and on to the grassy bank,
but the grass hurt his fins horribly, and when
he put his nose out of the water, the air stifled
him, and he was glad to slip back again.
Then he tried to jump out of the water, but he
could only jump straight up into the air, so of
course he fell straight down again into the
water. He began to be afraid, and the thought
that perhaps he was doomed to remain for ever
a fish was indeed a terrible one. He wanted
to cry, but the tears would not come out of his
eyes. Perhaps there was no room for any
more water in the moat.</p>

<p>The smaller fishes called to him in a friendly
jolly way to come and play with them&mdash;they
were having a quite exciting game of follow-my-leader
among some enormous water-lily
stalks that looked like trunks of great trees.
But Kenneth had no heart for games just then.</p>

<p>He swam miserably round the moat looking
for the old Carp, his only acquaintance in this
strange wet world. And at last, pushing
through a thick tangle of water weeds he found
the great fish.</p>

<p><a name="png.304" id="png.304"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">253</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Now then,&rsquo; said the Carp testily, &lsquo;haven&#8217;t
you any better manners than to come tearing a
gentleman&#8217;s bed-curtains like that?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said Kenneth Fish,
&lsquo;but I know how clever you are. Do please
help me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;What do you want now?&rsquo; said the Carp,
and spoke a little less crossly.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to get out. I want to go and be a
boy again.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you must have said you wanted to be
a fish.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I didn&#8217;t mean it, if I did.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You shouldn&#8217;t say what you don&#8217;t mean.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll try not to again,&rsquo; said Kenneth humbly,
&lsquo;but how can I get out?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;There&#8217;s only one way,&rsquo; said the Carp rolling
his vast body over in his watery bed, &lsquo;and
a jolly unpleasant way it is. Far better stay
here and be a good little fish. On the honour
of a gentleman that&#8217;s the best thing you can
do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to get out,&rsquo; said Kenneth again.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well then, the only way is &hellip; you know
we always teach the young fish to look out for
hooks so that they may avoid them. <em>You</em>
must look out for a hook and <em>take it</em>. Let
them catch you. On a hook.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Carp shuddered and went on solemnly,
<a name="png.305" id="png.305"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">254</span><span class="ns">
 </span>&lsquo;Have you strength? Have you patience?
Have you high courage and determination?
You will want them all. Have you all these?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I don&#8217;t know what I&#8217;ve got,&rsquo; said poor
Kenneth, &lsquo;except that I&#8217;ve got a tail and fins,
and I don&#8217;t know a hook when I see it. Won&#8217;t
you come with me? Oh! dear Mr. Doyen
Carp, <em>do</em> come and show me a hook.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It will hurt you,&rsquo; said the Carp, &lsquo;very
much indeed. You take a gentleman&#8217;s word
for it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know,&rsquo; said Kenneth, &lsquo;you needn&#8217;t rub it
in.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Carp rolled heavily out of his bed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Come on then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I don&#8217;t admire
your taste, but if you <em>want</em> a hook, well, the
gardener&#8217;s boy is fishing in the cool of the
evening. Come on.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He led the way with a steady stately movement.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I want to take the ring with me,&rsquo; said
Kenneth, &lsquo;but I can&#8217;t get hold of it. Do you
think you could put it on my fin with your
snout?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;My what!&rsquo; shouted the old Carp indignantly
and stopped dead.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your nose, I meant,&rsquo; said Kenneth. &lsquo;Oh!
please don&#8217;t be angry. It would be so kind of
you if you would. Shove the ring on, I mean.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.306" id="png.306"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">255</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;That will hurt too,&rsquo; said the Carp, and
Kenneth thought he seemed not altogether
sorry that it should.</p>

<p>It did hurt very much indeed. The ring
was hard and heavy, and somehow Kenneth&#8217;s
fin would not fold up small enough for the ring
to slip over it, and the Carp&#8217;s big mouth was
rather clumsy at the work. But at last it was
done. And then they set out in search of a
hook for Kenneth to be caught with.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I wish we could find one! I wish we
could!&rsquo; Kenneth Fish kept saying.</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re just looking for trouble,&rsquo; said the
Carp. &lsquo;Well, here you are!&rsquo;</p>

<p>Above them in the clear water hung a
delicious-looking worm. Kenneth Boy did not
like worms any better than you do, but to
Kenneth Fish that worm looked most tempting
and delightful.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Just wait a sec.,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;till I get that
worm.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You little silly,&rsquo; said the Carp, &lsquo;<em>that&#8217;s the
hook</em>. Take it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Wait a sec.,&rsquo; said Kenneth again.</p>

<p>His courage was beginning to ooze out of
his fin tips, and a shiver ran down him from
gills to tail.</p>

<p>&lsquo;If you once begin to think about a hook
you never take it,&rsquo; said the Carp.</p>

<p><a name="png.307" id="png.307"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">256</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;<em>Never?</em>&rsquo; said Kenneth &lsquo;Then &hellip; oh!
good-bye!&rsquo; he cried desperately, and snapped
at the worm. A sharp pain ran through his
head and he felt himself drawn up into the air,
that stifling, choking, husky, thick stuff in which
fish cannot breathe. And as he swung in the
air the dreadful thought came to him, &lsquo;Suppose
I don&#8217;t turn into a boy again? Suppose I keep
being a fish?&rsquo; And then he wished he hadn&#8217;t.
But it was too late to wish that.</p>

<p>Everything grew quite dark, only inside his
head there seemed to be a light. There was a
wild, rushing, buzzing noise, then something in
his head seemed to break and he knew no more.</p>

<div class="blockq fivestar">* * * * *</div>

<p>When presently he knew things again, he
was lying on something hard. Was he Kenneth
Fish lying on a stone at the bottom of the
moat, or Kenneth Boy lying somewhere out of
the water? His breathing was all right, so
he wasn&#8217;t a fish out of water or a boy under it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;He&#8217;s coming to,&rsquo; said a voice. The Carp&#8217;s
he thought it was. But next moment he knew
it to be the voice of his aunt, and he moved
his hand and felt grass in it. He opened his
eyes and saw above him the soft gray of the
evening sky with a star or two.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here&#8217;s the ring, Aunt,&rsquo; he said.</p>

 /></span>The cook had heard a splash and had run
out just as the picnic party arrived at the front
door. They had all rushed to the moat, and
the uncle had pulled Kenneth out with the
boat-hook. He had not been in the water
more than three minutes, they said. But
Kenneth knew better.</p>

<p>They carried him in, very wet he was, and
laid him on the breakfast-room sofa, where the
aunt with hurried thoughtfulness had spread
out the uncle&#8217;s mackintosh.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Get some rough towels, Jane,&rsquo; said the
aunt. &lsquo;Make haste, do.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I got the ring,&rsquo; said Kenneth.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Never mind about the ring, dear,&rsquo; said the
aunt, taking his boots off.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you said I was a thief and a liar,&rsquo;
Kenneth said feebly, &lsquo;and it was in the moat
all the time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;<em>Mother!</em>&rsquo; it was Alison who shrieked.
&lsquo;You didn&#8217;t say that to him?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Of course I didn&#8217;t,&rsquo; said the aunt impatiently.
She thought she hadn&#8217;t, but then Kenneth
thought she had.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It was <em>me</em> took the ring,&rsquo; said Alison, &lsquo;and
I dropped it. I didn&#8217;t say I hadn&#8217;t. I only
said I&#8217;d rather not say. Oh Mother! poor
Kenneth!&rsquo;</p>

<p>The aunt, without a word, carried Kenneth
<a name="png.311" id="png.311"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">258</span><span class="ns">
 </span>up to the bath-room and turned on the hot-water
tap. The uncle and Ethel followed.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Why didn&#8217;t you own up, you sneak?&rsquo; said
Conrad to his sister with withering scorn.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sneak,&rsquo; echoed the stout George.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I meant to. I was only getting steam up,&rsquo;
sobbed Alison. &lsquo;I didn&#8217;t know. Mother only
told us she wasn&#8217;t pleased with Ken, and so
he wasn&#8217;t to go to the picnic. Oh! what shall I
do? What shall I do?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Sneak!&rsquo; said her brothers in chorus, and
left her to her tears of shame and remorse.</p>

<p>It was Kenneth who next day begged
every one to forgive and forget. And as it was
<em>his</em> day&mdash;rather like a birthday, you know&mdash;when
no one could refuse him anything, all
agreed that the whole affair should be buried
in oblivion. Every one was tremendously kind,
the aunt more so than any one. But Alison&#8217;s
eyes were still red when in the afternoon they
all went fishing once more. And before
Kenneth&#8217;s hook had been two minutes in the
water there was a bite, a very big fish, the
uncle had to be called from his study to land it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here&#8217;s a magnificent fellow,&rsquo; said the uncle.
&lsquo;Not an ounce less than two pounds, Ken.
I&#8217;ll have it stuffed for you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And he held out the fish and Kenneth found
himself face to face with the Doyen Carp.
<a name="png.312" id="png.312"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">259</span><span class="ns">
 </span>There was no mistaking that mouth that
opened like a kit-bag, and shut in a sneer like
a rhinoceros&#8217;s. Its eye was most reproachful.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh! no,&rsquo; cried Kenneth, &lsquo;you helped me
back and I&#8217;ll help you back,&rsquo; and he caught the
Carp from the hands of the uncle and flung it
out in the moat.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your head&#8217;s not quite right yet, my boy,&rsquo;
said the uncle kindly. &lsquo;Hadn&#8217;t you better go
in and lie down a bit?&rsquo;</p>

<p>But Alison understood, for he had told
her the whole story. He had told her that
morning before breakfast while she was still in
deep disgrace; to cheer her up, he said. And,
most disappointingly, it made her cry more than
ever.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your poor little fins,&rsquo; she had said, &lsquo;and
having your feet tied up in your tail. And it
was all my fault.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="pgbrk">&lsquo;I liked it,&rsquo; Kenneth had said with earnest
politeness, &lsquo;it was a most awful lark.&rsquo; And
he quite meant what he said.</p>

 /></span><b>XII</b><br
 />THE MAGICIAN&#8217;S HEART</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">We</span> all have our weaknesses. Mine is mulberries.
Yours, perhaps, motor cars. Professor
Taykin&#8217;s was christenings&mdash;royal christenings.
He always expected to be asked to the christening
parties of all the little royal babies, and
of course he never was, because he was not
a lord, or a duke, or a seller of bacon and
tea, or anything really high-class, but merely
a wicked magician, who by economy and strict
attention to customers had worked up a very
good business of his own. He had not always
been wicked. He was born quite good, I
believe, and his old nurse, who had long since
married a farmer and retired into the calm of
country life, always used to say that he was
the duckiest little boy in a plaid frock with
the dearest little fat legs. But he had changed
since he was a boy, as a good many other
people do&mdash;perhaps it was his trade. I dare
say you&#8217;ve noticed that cobblers are usually
<a name="png.314" id="png.314"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">261</span><span class="ns">
 </span>thin, and brewers are generally fat, and
magicians are almost always wicked.</p>

<p>Well, his weakness (for christenings) grew
stronger and stronger because it was never
indulged, and at last he &lsquo;took the bull into
his own hands,&rsquo; as the Irish footman at the
palace said, and went to a christening without
being asked. It was a very grand party given
by the King of the Fortunate Islands, and the
little prince was christened Fortunatus. No
one took any notice of Professor Taykin. They
were too polite to turn him out, but they made
him wish he&#8217;d never come. He felt quite an
outsider, as indeed he was, and this made him
furious. So that when all the bright, light,
laughing, fairy godmothers were crowding round
the blue satin cradle, and giving gifts of beauty
and strength and goodness to the baby, the
Magician suddenly did a very difficult charm
(in his head, like you do mental arithmetic),
and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Young Forty may be all that, but <em>I</em> say
he shall be the stupidest prince in the world,&rsquo;
and on that he vanished in a puff of red smoke
with a smell like the Fifth of November in a
back garden on Streatham Hill, and as he left
no address the King of the Fortunate Islands
couldn&#8217;t prosecute him for high treason.</p>

<p>Taykin was very glad to think that he had
<a name="png.315" id="png.315"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">262</span><span class="ns">
 </span>made such a lot of people unhappy&mdash;the whole
Court was in tears when he left, including the
baby&mdash;and he looked in the papers for another
royal christening, so that he could go to
that and make a lot more people miserable.
And there was one fixed for the very next
Wednesday. The Magician went to that, too,
disguised as a wealthy.</p>

<p>This time the baby was a girl. Taykin
kept close to the pink velvet cradle, and when
all the nice qualities in the world had been
given to the Princess he suddenly said, &lsquo;Little
Aura may be all that, but <em>I</em> say she shall be
the ugliest princess in all the world.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And instantly she was. It was terrible.
And she had been such a beautiful baby too.
Every one had been saying that she was the
most beautiful baby they had ever seen. This
sort of thing is often said at christenings.</p>

<p>Having uglified the unfortunate little Princess
the Magician did the spell (in his mind,
just as you do your spelling) to make himself
vanish, but to his horror there was no red
smoke and no smell of fireworks, and there
he was, still, where he now very much wished
not to be. Because one of the fairies there
had seen, just one second too late to save the
Princess, what he was up to, and had made a
strong little charm in a great hurry to prevent
<a name="png.316" id="png.316"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">263</span><span class="ns">
 </span>his vanishing. This Fairy was a White Witch,
and of course you know that White Magic is
much stronger than Black Magic, as well as
more suited for drawing-room performances.
So there the Magician stood, &lsquo;looking like a
thunder-struck pig,&rsquo; as some one unkindly said,
and the dear White Witch bent down and
kissed the baby princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;There!&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you can keep that kiss
till you want it. When the time comes you&#8217;ll
know what to do with it. The Magician can&#8217;t
vanish, Sire. You&#8217;d better arrest him.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Arrest that person,&rsquo; said the King, pointing
to Taykin. &lsquo;I suppose your charms are of a
permanent nature, madam.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite,&rsquo; said the Fairy, &lsquo;at least they never
go till there&#8217;s no longer any use for them.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Magician was shut up in an enormously
high tower, and allowed to play with
magic; but none of his spells could act outside
the tower so he was never able to pass the
extra double guard that watched outside night
and day. The King would have liked to have
the Magician executed but the White Witch
warned him that this would never do.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Don&#8217;t you see,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;he&#8217;s the only
person who can make the Princess beautiful
again. And he&#8217;ll do it some day. But don&#8217;t
you go <em>asking</em> him to do it. He&#8217;ll never do
<a name="png.317" id="png.317"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">264</span><span class="ns">
 </span>anything to oblige you. He&#8217;s that sort of
man.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the years rolled on. The Magician
stayed in the tower and did magic and was
very bored,&mdash;for it is dull to take white rabbits
out of your hat, and your hat out of nothing
when there&#8217;s no one to see you.</p>

<p>Prince Fortunatus was such a stupid little
boy that he got lost quite early in the story,
and went about the country saying his name
was James, which it wasn&#8217;t. A baker&#8217;s wife
found him and adopted him, and sold the
diamond buttons of his little overcoat, for three
hundred pounds, and as she was a very honest
woman she put two hundred away for James
to have when he grew up.</p>

<p>The years rolled on. Aura continued to
be hideous, and she was very unhappy, till
on her twentieth birthday her married cousin
Belinda came to see her. Now Belinda had
been made ugly in her cradle too, so she could
sympathise as no one else could.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But <em>I</em> got out of it all right, and so will
you,&rsquo; said Belinda. &lsquo;I&#8217;m sure the first thing
to do is to find a magician.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Father banished them all twenty years
ago,&rsquo; said Aura behind her veil, &lsquo;all but the
one who uglified me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then I should go to <em>him</em>,&rsquo; said beautiful
<a name="png.318" id="png.318"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">265</span><span class="ns">
 </span>Belinda. &lsquo;Dress up as a beggar maid, and
give him fifty pounds to do it. Not more,
or he may suspect that you&#8217;re not a beggar
maid. It will be great fun. I&#8217;d go with you
only I promised Bellamant faithfully that I&#8217;d
be home to lunch.&rsquo; And off she went in her
mother-of-pearl coach, leaving Aura to look
through the bound volumes of <cite>The Perfect
Lady</cite> in the palace library, to find out the
proper costume for a beggar maid.</p>

<p>Now that very morning the Magician&#8217;s old
nurse had packed up a ham, and some eggs,
and some honey, and some apples, and a sweet
bunch of old-fashioned flowers, and borrowed
the baker&#8217;s boy to hold the horse for her,
and started off to see the Magician. It was
forty years since she&#8217;d seen him, but she loved
him still, and now she thought she could do
him a good turn. She asked in the town for
his address, and learned that he lived in the
Black Tower.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But you&#8217;d best be careful,&rsquo; the townsfolk
said, &lsquo;he&#8217;s a spiteful chap.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Bless you,&rsquo; said the old nurse, &lsquo;he won&#8217;t
hurt me as nursed him when he was a babe,
in a plaid frock with the dearest little fat legs
ever you see.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she got to the tower, and the guards let
her through. Taykin was almost pleased to
<a name="png.319" id="png.319"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">266</span><span class="ns">
 </span>see her&mdash;remember he had had no visitors for
twenty years&mdash;and he was quite pleased to see
the ham and the honey.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But where did I put them <em>h</em>eggs?&rsquo; said the
nurse, &lsquo;and the apples&mdash;I must have left them
at home after all.&rsquo;</p>

<p>She had. But the Magician just waved his
hand in the air, and there was a basket of <!-- Transcriber's note: original reads "of of" -->
apples that hadn&#8217;t been there before. The
eggs he took out of her bonnet, the folds of
her shawl, and even from his own mouth, just
like a conjurer does. Only of course he was
a real Magician.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it&#8217;s like magic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;It <em>is</em> magic,&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;That&#8217;s my trade.
It&#8217;s quite a pleasure to have an audience again.
I&#8217;ve lived here alone for twenty years. It&#8217;s
very lonely, especially of an evening.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can&#8217;t you get out?&rsquo; said the nurse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No. King&#8217;s orders must be respected, but
it&#8217;s a dog&#8217;s life.&rsquo; He sniffed, made himself a
magic handkerchief out of empty air, and
wiped his eyes.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Take an apprentice, my dear,&rsquo; said the
nurse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;And teach him my magic? Not me.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Suppose you got one so stupid he <em>couldn&#8217;t</em>
learn?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That would be all right&mdash;but it&#8217;s no use
<a name="png.320" id="png.320"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">267</span><span class="ns">
 </span>advertising for a stupid person&mdash;you&#8217;d get no
answers.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You needn&#8217;t advertise,&rsquo; said the nurse;
and she went out and brought in James, who
was really the Prince of the Fortunate Islands,
and also the baker&#8217;s boy she had brought with
her to hold the horse&#8217;s head.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Now, James,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you&#8217;d like to be
apprenticed, wouldn&#8217;t you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the poor stupid boy.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then give the gentleman your money,
James.&rsquo;</p>

<p>James did.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My last doubts vanish,&rsquo; said the Magician, &lsquo;he
<em>is</em> stupid. Nurse, let us celebrate the occasion
with a little drop of something. Not before
the boy because of setting an example. James,
wash up. Not here, silly; in the back kitchen.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So James washed up, and as he was very
clumsy he happened to break a little bottle of
essence of dreams that was on the shelf, and
instantly there floated up from the washing-up
water the vision of a princess more beautiful
than the day&mdash;so beautiful that even James
could not help seeing how beautiful she was,
and holding out his arms to her as she came
floating through the air above the kitchen sink.
But when he held out his arms she vanished.
He sighed and washed up harder than ever.</p>

<p><a name="png.321" id="png.321"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">268</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;I wish I wasn&#8217;t so stupid,&rsquo; he said, and
then there was a knock at the door. James
wiped his hands and opened. Some one stood
there in very picturesque rags and tatters.
&lsquo;Please,&rsquo; said some one, who was of course the
Princess, &lsquo;is Professor Taykin at home?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Walk in, please,&rsquo; said James.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My snakes alive!&rsquo; said Taykin, &lsquo;what a day
we&#8217;re having. Three visitors in one morning.
How kind of you to call. Won&#8217;t you take a
chair?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I hoped,&rsquo; said the veiled Princess, &lsquo;that
you&#8217;d give me something else to take.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A glass of wine,&rsquo; said Taykin. &lsquo;You&#8217;ll
take a glass of wine?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, thank you,&rsquo; said the beggar maid who
was the Princess.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then take &hellip; take your veil off,&rsquo; said
the nurse, &lsquo;or you won&#8217;t feel the benefit of it
when you go out.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I can&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Aura, &lsquo;it wouldn&#8217;t be safe.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Too beautiful, eh?&rsquo; said the Magician.
&lsquo;Still&mdash;you&#8217;re quite safe here.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Can you do magic?&rsquo; she abruptly asked.</p>

<p>&lsquo;A little,&rsquo; said he ironically.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;it&#8217;s like this. I&#8217;m so ugly
no one can bear to look at me. And I want
to go as kitchenmaid to the palace. They
want a cook and a scullion and a kitchenmaid.
<a name="png.322" id="png.322"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">269</span><span class="ns">
 </span>I thought perhaps you&#8217;d give me something
to make me pretty. I&#8217;m only a poor beggar
maid&hellip;. It would be a great thing to me if&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Go along with you,&rsquo; said Taykin, very
cross indeed. &lsquo;I never give to beggars.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Here&#8217;s twopence,&rsquo; whispered poor James,
pressing it into her hand, &lsquo;it&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve got left.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you,&rsquo; she whispered back. &lsquo;You
<em>are</em> good.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And to the Magician she said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I happen to have fifty pounds. I&#8217;ll give it
you for a new face.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Done,&rsquo; cried Taykin. &lsquo;Here&#8217;s another
stupid one!&rsquo; He grabbed the money, waved
his wand, and then and there before the
astonished eyes of the nurse and the apprentice
the ugly beggar maid became the loveliest
princess in the world.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; said the nurse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My dream!&rsquo; cried the apprentice.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Please,&rsquo; said the Princess, &lsquo;can I have a
looking-glass?&rsquo; The apprentice ran to unhook
the one that hung over the kitchen sink, and
handed it to her. &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;how <em>very</em>
pretty I am. How can I thank you?&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Quite easily,&rsquo; said the Magician, &lsquo;beggar
maid as you are, I hereby offer you my hand
and heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He put his hand into his waistcoat and
<a name="png.323" id="png.323"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">270</span><span class="ns">
 </span>pulled out his heart. It was fat and pink, and
the Princess did not like the look of it.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Thank you very much,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but I&#8217;d
rather not.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;But I insist,&rsquo; said Taykin.</p>

<p>&lsquo;But really, your offer&hellip;.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Most handsome, I&#8217;m sure,&rsquo; said the nurse.</p>

<p>&lsquo;My affections are engaged,&rsquo; said the
Princess, looking down. &lsquo;I can&#8217;t marry you.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Am I to take this as a refusal?&rsquo; asked
Taykin; and the Princess said she feared that
he was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Very well, then,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I shall see you
home, and ask your father about it. He&#8217;ll
not let you refuse an offer like this. Nurse,
come and tie my necktie.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So he went out, and the nurse with him.</p>

<p>Then the Princess told the apprentice in
a very great hurry who she was.</p>

<p>&lsquo;It would never do,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;for him to
see me home. He&#8217;d find out that I was the
Princess, and he&#8217;d uglify me again in no
time.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;He sha&#8217;n&#8217;t see you home,&rsquo; said James. &lsquo;I
may be stupid but I&#8217;m strong too.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;How brave you are,&rsquo; said Aura admiringly,
&lsquo;but I&#8217;d rather slip away quietly, without any
fuss. Can&#8217;t you undo the patent lock of that
door?&rsquo; The apprentice tried but he was too
<a name="png.324" id="png.324"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">271</span><span class="ns">
 </span>stupid, and the Princess was not strong
enough.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;m sorry,&rsquo; said the apprentice who was a
Prince. &lsquo;I can&#8217;t undo the door, but when <em>he</em>
does I&#8217;ll hold him and you can get away. I
dreamed of you this morning,&rsquo; he added.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I dreamed of you too,&rsquo; said she, &lsquo;but you
were different.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Perhaps,&rsquo; said poor James sadly, &lsquo;the
person you dreamed about wasn&#8217;t stupid, and
I am.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Are you <em>really</em>?&rsquo; cried the Princess. &lsquo;I
<em>am</em> so glad!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;That&#8217;s rather unkind, isn&#8217;t it?&rsquo; said he.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No; because if <em>that&#8217;s</em> all that makes you
different from the man I dreamed about I can
soon make <em>that</em> all right.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And with that she put her hands on his
shoulders and kissed him. And at her kiss
his stupidness passed away like a cloud, and
he became as clever as any one need be; and
besides knowing all the ordinary lessons he
would have learned if he had stayed at home
in his palace, he knew who he was, and where
he was, and why, and he knew all the geography
of his father&#8217;s kingdom, and the exports and
imports and the condition of politics. And he
knew also that the Princess loved him.</p>

<p>So he caught her in his arms and kissed
<a name="png.325" id="png.325"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">272</span><span class="ns">
 </span>her, and they were very happy, and told each
other over and over again what a beautiful
world it was, and how wonderful it was that
they should have found each other, seeing that
the world is not only beautiful but rather large.</p>

<p>&lsquo;That first one was a magic kiss, you know,&rsquo;
said she. &lsquo;My fairy godmother gave it to me,
and I&#8217;ve been keeping it all these years for
you. You must get away from here, and come
to the palace. Oh, you&#8217;ll manage it&mdash;you&#8217;re
clever now.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;I <em>am</em> clever now. I can
undo the lock for you. Go, my dear, go
before he comes back.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So the Princess went. And only just in
time; for as she went out of one door Taykin
came in at the other.</p>

<p>He was furious to find her gone; and I
should not like to write down the things he
said to his apprentice when he found that
James had been so stupid as to open the door
for her. They were not polite things at all.</p>

<p>He tried to follow her. But the Princess
had warned the guards, and he could not get
out.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;if only my old magic would
work outside this tower. I&#8217;d soon be even
with her.&rsquo;</p>

<p>And then in a strange, confused, yet quite
<a name="png.326" id="png.326"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">273</span><span class="ns">
 </span>sure way, he felt that the spell that held him,
the White Witch&#8217;s spell, was dissolved.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To the palace!&rsquo; he cried; and rushing to
the cauldron that hung over the fire he leaped
into it, leaped out in the form of a red lion,
and disappeared.</p>

<p>Without a moment&#8217;s hesitation the Prince,
who was his apprentice, followed him, calling
out the same words and leaping into the same
cauldron, while the poor nurse screamed and
wrung her hands. As he touched the liquor
in the cauldron he felt that he was not quite
himself. He was, in fact, a green dragon.
He felt himself vanish&mdash;a most uncomfortable
sensation&mdash;and reappeared, with a suddenness
that took his breath away, in his own form and
at the back door of the palace.</p>

<p>The time had been short, but already the
Magician had succeeded in obtaining an engagement
as palace cook. How he did it
without references I don&#8217;t know. Perhaps he
made the references by magic as he had made
the eggs, and the apples, and the handkerchief.</p>

<p>Taykin&#8217;s astonishment and annoyance at
being followed by his faithful apprentice were
soon soothed, for he saw that a stupid scullion
would be of great use. Of course he had no
idea that James had been made clever by a
kiss.</p>

<p><a name="png.327" id="png.327"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">274</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;But how are you going to cook?&rsquo; asked
the apprentice. &lsquo;You don&#8217;t know how!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I shall cook,&rsquo; said Taykin, &lsquo;as I do everything
else&mdash;by magic.&rsquo; And he did. I wish
I had time to tell you how he turned out a
hot dinner of seventeen courses from totally
empty saucepans, how James looked in a cupboard
for spices and found it empty, and how
next moment the nurse walked out of it. The
Magician had been so long alone that he
seemed to revel in the luxury of showing
off to some one, and he leaped about from
one cupboard to another, produced cats and
cockatoos out of empty jars, and made mice
and rabbits disappear and reappear till James&#8217;s
head was in a whirl, for all his cleverness; and
the nurse, as she washed up, wept tears of
pure joy at her boy&#8217;s wonderful skill.</p>

<p>&lsquo;All this excitement&#8217;s bad for my heart,
though,&rsquo; Taykin said at last, and pulling his
heart out of his chest, he put it on a shelf, and
as he did so his magic note-book fell from his
breast and the apprentice picked it up. Taykin
did not see him do it; he was busy making the
kitchen lamp fly about the room like a pigeon.</p>

<p>It was just then that the Princess came in,
looking more lovely than ever in a simple
little morning frock of white chiffon and
diamonds.</p>

<p><a name="png.328" id="png.328"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">275</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;The beggar maid,&rsquo; said Taykin, &lsquo;looking
like a princess! I&#8217;ll marry her just the
same.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ve come to give the orders for dinner,&rsquo;
she said; and then she saw who it was, and
gave one little cry and stood still, trembling.</p>

<p>&lsquo;To order the dinner,&rsquo; said the nurse.
&lsquo;Then <span class="nw">you&#8217;re&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Aura, &lsquo;I&#8217;m the Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You&#8217;re the Princess,&rsquo; said the Magician.
&lsquo;Then I&#8217;ll marry you all the more. And if
you say no I&#8217;ll uglify you as the word leaves
your lips. Oh, yes&mdash;you think I&#8217;ve just been
amusing myself over my cooking&mdash;but I&#8217;ve
really been brewing the strongest spell in the
world. Marry me&mdash;or <span class="nw">drink&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo;</span></p>

<p>The Princess shuddered at these dreadful
words.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Drink, or marry me,&rsquo; said the Magician.
&lsquo;If you marry me you shall be beautiful for
ever.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Ah,&rsquo; said the nurse, &lsquo;he&#8217;s a match even for
a Princess.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll tell papa,&rsquo; said the Princess, sobbing.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No, you won&#8217;t,&rsquo; said Taykin. &lsquo;Your father
will never know. If you won&#8217;t marry me you
shall drink this and become my scullery maid&mdash;my
hideous scullery maid&mdash;and wash up for
ever in the lonely tower.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.329" id="png.329"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">276</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>He caught her by the wrist.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop,&rsquo; cried the apprentice, who was a
Prince.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop? <em>Me?</em> Nonsense! Pooh!&rsquo; said
the Magician.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Stop, I say!&rsquo; said James, who was
Fortunatus. &lsquo;<em>I&#8217;ve got your heart!</em>&rsquo; He had&mdash;and
he held it up in one hand, and in the
other a cooking knife.</p>

<p>&lsquo;One step nearer that lady,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;and
in goes the knife.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Magician positively skipped in his
agony and terror.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I say, look out!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Be careful
what you&#8217;re doing. Accidents happen so
easily! Suppose your foot slipped! Then no
apologies would meet the case. That&#8217;s my
heart you&#8217;ve got there. My life&#8217;s bound up
in it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;I know. That&#8217;s often the case with people&#8217;s
hearts,&rsquo; said Fortunatus. &lsquo;We&#8217;ve got you, my
dear sir, on toast. My Princess, might I
trouble you to call the guards.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Magician did not dare to resist, so the
guards arrested him. The nurse, though in
floods of tears, managed to serve up a very good
plain dinner, and after dinner the Magician
was brought before the King.</p>

<p>Now the King, as soon as he had seen that
<a name="png.330" id="png.330"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">277</span><span class="ns">
 </span>his daughter had been made so beautiful, had
caused a large number of princes to be fetched
by telephone. He was anxious to get her
married at once in case she turned ugly again.
So before he could do justice to the Magician
he had to settle which of the princes was to
marry the Princess. He had chosen the Prince
of the Diamond Mountains, a very nice steady
young man with a good income. But when
he suggested the match to the Princess she
declined it, and the Magician, who was standing
at the foot of the throne steps loaded with
chains, clattered forward and said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;Your Majesty, will you spare my life if I
tell you something you don&#8217;t know?&rsquo;</p>

<p>The King, who was a very inquisitive man,
said &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Then know,&rsquo; said Taykin, &lsquo;that the Princess
won&#8217;t marry <em>your</em> choice, because she&#8217;s made
one of her own&mdash;my apprentice.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess meant to have told her father
this when she had got him alone and in a good
temper. But now he was in a bad temper, and
in full audience.</p>

<p>The apprentice was dragged in, and all the
Princess&#8217;s agonized pleadings only got this out
of the King&mdash;</p>

<p>&lsquo;All right. I won&#8217;t hang him. He shall be
best man at your wedding.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.331" id="png.331"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">278</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>
Then the King took his daughter&#8217;s hand
and set her in the middle of the hall, and set
the Prince of the Diamond Mountains on her
right and the apprentice on her left. Then he
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will spare the life of this aspiring youth
on your left if you&#8217;ll promise never to speak to
him again, and if you&#8217;ll promise to marry the
gentleman on your right before tea this afternoon.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The wretched Princess looked at her lover,
and his lips formed the word &lsquo;Promise.&rsquo;</p>

<p>So she said: &lsquo;I promise never to speak to
the gentleman on my left and to marry the
gentleman on my right before tea to-day,&rsquo; and
held out her hand to the Prince of the
Diamond Mountains.</p>

<p>Then suddenly, in the twinkling of an eye,
the Prince of the Diamond Mountains was on
her left, and her hand was held by her own
Prince, who stood at her right hand. And yet
nobody seemed to have moved. It was the
purest and most high-class magic.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Dished,&rsquo; cried the King, &lsquo;absolutely
dished!&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;A mere trifle,&rsquo; said the apprentice modestly.
&lsquo;I&#8217;ve got Taykin&#8217;s magic recipe book, as well
as his heart.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Well, we must make the best of it, I
<a name="png.332" id="png.332"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">279</span><span class="ns">
 </span>suppose,&rsquo; said the King crossly. &lsquo;Bless you,
my children.&rsquo;</p>

<p>He was less cross when it was explained
to him that the apprentice was really the Prince
of the Fortunate Islands, and a much better
match than the Prince of the Diamond
Mountains, and he was quite in a good temper
by the time the nurse threw herself in front of
the throne and begged the King to let the
Magician off altogether&mdash;chiefly on the ground
that when he was a baby he was the dearest
little duck that ever was, in the prettiest plaid
frock, with the loveliest fat legs.</p>

<p>The King, moved by these arguments,
said:</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll spare him if he&#8217;ll promise to be good.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;You will, ducky, won&#8217;t you?&rsquo; said the
nurse, crying.</p>

<p>&lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the Magician, &lsquo;I won&#8217;t; and
what&#8217;s more, I can&#8217;t.&rsquo;</p>

<p>The Princess, who was now so happy that
she wanted every one else to be happy too,
begged her lover to make Taykin good &lsquo;by
magic.&rsquo;</p>

<p>&lsquo;Alas, my dearest Lady,&rsquo; said the Prince,
&lsquo;no one can be made good by magic. I could
take the badness out of him&mdash;there&#8217;s an
excellent recipe in this note-book&mdash;but if I
did that there&#8217;d be so very little left.&rsquo;</p>

<p><a name="png.333" id="png.333"></a><span class="ns">[p</span><span
 class="pgmark">280</span><span class="ns">]<br
 /></span>&lsquo;Every little helps,&rsquo; said the nurse wildly.</p>

<p>Prince Fortunatus, who was James, who
was the apprentice, studied the book for a
few moments, and then said a few words in
a language no one present had ever heard
before.</p>

<p>And as he spoke the wicked Magician began
to tremble and shrink.</p>

<p>&lsquo;Oh, my boy&mdash;be good! Promise you&#8217;ll be
good,&rsquo; cried the nurse, still in tears.</p>

<p>The Magician seemed to be shrinking inside
his clothes. He grew smaller and smaller.
The nurse caught him in her arms, and still
he grew less and less, till she seemed to be
holding nothing but a bundle of clothes. Then
with a cry of love and triumph she tore the
Magician&#8217;s clothes away and held up a chubby
baby boy, with the very plaid frock and fat legs
she had so often and so lovingly described.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I said there wouldn&#8217;t be much of him
when the badness was out,&rsquo; said the Prince
Fortunatus.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I will be good; oh, I will,&rsquo; said the baby
boy that had been the Magician.</p>

<p>&lsquo;I&#8217;ll see to that,&rsquo; said the nurse. And so
the story ends with love and a wedding, and
showers of white roses.</p>
